5/31/14,1,B,LETTERS - Gun debate back in our sights ,"
Where fault lies
Regarding the ""Collateral damage"" editorial (Page B8, Thursday), of the nine paragraphs devoted to the anti-gun piece, one single sentence stands out to expose your hypocrisy and answer the opening question, ""Why did Chris die?"" Buried in the middle of the piece, probably hoping no one would notice, is this: ""And yes, he killed with knives as well as guns."" There you have it, right in front of you, but the choice to politicize tragedy in order to promote an agenda seems to trump the truth these days.
Chris died, not because of "" craven, irresponsible politicians and the NRA."" He died because a deranged criminal chose to violate the most sacrosanct tenet of civil society by committing murder. To be brutally frank, this tragedy has nothing to do with either the NRA or craven politicians. If you choose not to believe me, then ask the families of the three souls stabbed to death.
Lionel J. Rotelli Jr., Conroe Solutions?
Reading the headline about needing to change America's gun culture, I was intrigued. Much of the gun violence occurs where the gun laws are the most strict, as in Chicago. Some of the recent dead were killed with a knife and there have been some mass stabbings as well. So, I assumed that the editorial was going to discuss solutions to reduce the exposure to guns such as eliminating all movies, TV shows, video games, newspapers and books that include guns. While we are at it, we should do the same with knives.
Unfortunately, such a solution would violate our beloved First Amendment. We should never allow that, but it is politically correct to consider the same for the hated Second Amendment.
Pat Wetuski, Kingwood More study
Your editorial, once again, made me proud to be a subscriber. Please do not stop. Your point about the law change in Australia was extremely valid but please elaborate in more detail. If necessary, go country by country, to drive the point home. Please analyze every aspect of this American phenomenon: Cultural leanings, NRA's self-interest, mentally imbalanced individuals, type of heavy machines, etc.
After a lengthy and detailed study, you would know that you have accomplished something for the city of Houston and perhaps, if copied by others, the country.

Care about victims
Regarding ""Tax-collection vendors tied to lawmakers, officials (Page B1, Monday), I am concerned when large law firms involved in the collection of delinquent taxes can influence the process by hiring attorneys who also serve as state legislators. I am just as concerned when these same law firms can influence the news coverage by hiring media people to serve as spokespersons. Overall, the names listed in this article were a who's-who of local government, with everyone using their connections to get in on lucrative government contracts. In this case, it was mostly Democrats, but that's only because the Republicans have a different group of backers - homebuilders, oil and gas - making sure their financial needs are met.
As a citizen, you're left to wonder if there's anyone left who could be considered clean. Matthew Bradley, Spring
Rights of all
Regarding ""Council approves extension of rights protection to gays"" (Page A1, Thursday), David Welch of the Houston Area Pastors Council believes the Houston City Council catered to a ""tiny interest group ... instead of serving the people"" of Houston by passing the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
I'm amazed he thinks the only ones concerned for the civil liberties of the LGBT community are members of that community alone. If we are not concerned about the civil liberties of everyone, everyone's liberties are at risk.
To deny housing, employment or equal protection under the law because of sexual orientation defies logic, ethics and the U.S. Constitution.
The Houston City Council did serve the people when they chose to protect the rights of all.
Martha Nelson, Houston
Explaining the VA
Regarding ""VA staff alleged to have altered records"" (Page A1, Sunday), I am a vet in the system and this is an attempt to explain the current system.
Imagine Houston with only one hospital and only six primary-care doctors, and their offices are in the hospital. All imaging and testing is in the hospital, as well.
Try to get an appointment in that system, or a parking space. Try to fight the traffic.
The medical staff is not the problem. I have always been treated with the utmost respect and caring. Increased capacity is the expensive answer, and that can only be solved by Congress.
David Koger, Rosenberg Tell the stories
Regarding Joe Holley's column ""WWII veterans silent but not forgotten"" (Page B1, Sunday), the article really struck a chord with me. I'm a 55-year-old white female and, though no one in my immediate family served during World War II, it is one of my favorite periods of history.
My deceased husband had three uncles in the war, two who died in the D-Day invasion. The third uncle did make it home from the Pacific theatre, but with a permanent injury. My current husband's parents both served during WWII, which is how they met. Hubby's maternal uncle also served in WWII as a pilot.
So, please tell Cousin Bob that he must tell his story. Not only for himself but for all the young American men and women who died preserving the freedom we as U.S. citizens enjoy.
If those courageous young people had not stepped up to the line, where would the world be? I hope and pray you hear from many more readers saying the same thing: that Cousin Bob is wrong, people do care and want to hear the stories.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,943,78.27,53.36,27.63,16.6,18.13,23.86,84.62,62.57,50.16,8.91,5.2,1.7,0.64,1.06,0.64,0.53,3.71,16.12,9.01,1.91,13.04,6.89,4.56,6.68,1.27,13.47,6.47,3.92,6.04,1.59,1.06,3.39,14.21,2.01,12.2,2.97,1.48,1.91,2.23,0.32,3.82,0.11,4.56,1.91,2.23,1.27,0.53,0.32,0,0.11,0.21,0,13.79,5.51,0.85,0.95,0.64,0.95,1.7,7.32,1.17,0,0.42,1.48,3.61,2.76,0.42,0.42,4.14,0.53,0.32,2.55,0.42,0.32,2.12,0.64,0.32,0,0,0,0.32,0,1.17,0.42,0.32,0.32,0,0,0,0.11,0.42,0.32,3.18,6.57,0.42,0.42,5.3,0.11,0.32,0.11,3.18,3.82,3.71,0.53,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,19.3,6.15,7.32,0.32,0,1.27,4.24,0,0.95,0.11,0.11,0,0.42,3.44,3.46,2.97,2.99,2.73,-3.74,-2.62,-1.14,-1.89,-2.42,0.42,0.21,0.64,1.06,1.17,0.21,1.17,0,0.53,0,0.42,0.11,1.38,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,0.11,2.12,1.19,18.96,233.3,1.7,371.16,-0.11,159.07,1.48,148.46,1.27,159.07,-0.95,159.07,0.21,360.55,0,74.23,-0.32,53.02,0.42,31.81,0,159.07,116.65,95.44,74.23,31.81,95.44,0,116.65,53.02,10.6,84.84,0,0,0,106.04,74.23,106.04,31.81,21.21,0,2.23,1,0,0.95,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,1
5/29/14,1,A,"Council approves extension of rights protection to gays - Mayor hails vote, but opponents vow to force recalls, referendum ","After nearly nine hours of discussion, punctuated by opponents chanting outside City Hall and by emotional supporters' personal stories of discrimination, the Houston City Council on Wednesday passed an ordinance extending equal rights protections to gay and transgender residents.
Public dissension has persisted for weeks, but the final vote was 11-6, a count that matched guesses made months ago when Mayor Annise Parker - the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city - said she planned to bring the measure forward.
The approval was greeted with applause from the audience, largely full of supporters by the time of the vote, and chants of ""HERO,"" for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
Opponents vow to gather the signatures needed to trigger a referendum to repeal the law this November, and others say they plan to seek recall elections against some council members who supported the measure.
Reflecting after the vote, Parker mentioned her son, who is gay and black, and her daughters, who are biracial.
""This is not the most important thing I have done or will do as mayor, but it is the most personally satisfying and most personally meaningful thing I will do as mayor - not just for myself, but for my children and for all the other mothers' children out there who have an opportunity to have redress if they are discriminated against here in the city of Houston,"" the mayor said.
The measure bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.
Council members Brenda Stardig, Dwight Boykins, Dave Martin, Oliver Pennington, Michael Kubosh and Jack Christie voted no, saying either that they must represent their constituents or that they had been left out of the drafting process.
""I want to represent all the city of Houston,"" Kubosh said, ""but I have a problem voting against what I feel like the majority of the city of Houston voters are asking me to do.""
Marathon testimony
In the marathon testimony - the speakers list was the longest City Secretary Anna Russell could recall, and she has worked for the city for six decades - supporters stressed that the eyes of the world and of companies deciding whether to relocate to Houston were watching the vote, just as opponents invoked the gaze of God and of vengeful voters in next year's municipal elections - or at the ballot box this fall.
Opponent Dave Welch, of the Houston Area Pastors Council, said his group will begin gathering signatures against the ordinance to trigger a referendum seeking its repeal this November. The group would need to gather roughly 17,000 signatures - or 10 percent of turnout in last fall's mayoral race - in the next 30 days.
""Once we correct this grievous act through the ballot this fall,"" Welch said in a statement, ""we will then remind those members that patronizing a tiny interest group and outgoing mayor instead of serving the people leads to a short political career."" Parker said she would encourage those desiring repeal to respect the will of the City Council.
""The idea that we might possibly have a vote in November on whether or not the city of Houston should discriminate, I think, would be unfortunate,"" Parker said, ""but they have the right to do that.""
Houston voters twice have rejected protections or benefits for gays, in 1985 and in 2001.
The most recent vote was spearheaded by Houston Community College trustee and longtime anti-gay advocate Dave Wilson, who said he plans to gather signatures to seek a recall election against ""three or four"" council members who voted yes.
Only the number of signatures equivalent to one-quarter of the votes cast for mayor in a given council district are required, which Wilson said makes some districts with poor turnout particularly ripe targets.
The signatures must be gathered within a 30-day period and a recall petition must list grounds related to ""incompetence, misconduct, malfeasance or unfitness for office."" The target of such a petition could then object, triggering a vote of the City Council on whether the grounds are sufficient. City Attorney David Feldman said the city's 100-year-old recall process has never been used, and added a single ordinance vote would not be valid grounds.
""Some people say it's intimidation, et cetera, but I look at it as accountability,"" Wilson said, adding he views Feldman as a biased source. ""People are elected to represent their district. They're not up there to propagate their own personal views.""
Wilson said he also is gathering the signatures needed to seek a charter amendment banning a biological man from using a women's restroom. The ordinance passed Wednesday offers such a protection for transgender residents citywide, as does an executive order Parker signed in 2010 applying to city facilities.
Charter vote
The earliest a charter vote could appear would be May 2015, but Feldman said such an effort may be too relevant to the ordinance passed Wednesday, meaning the signatures gathered would need to fall within the 30-day window.
Councilman Jerry Davis referenced public backlash in explaining his support for the ordinance, invoking his daughters and his 9- year-old son.
""He probably will go through some of the same discriminatory practices that have been acted out on me, and I want a better city for him,"" said Davis, who is black and has shared his own experiences of discrimination. ""For those out there going around threatening me as it relates to, 'We won't vote for you,' that's fine, if that's the way you choose to feel. I won't be bothered by idle threats.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,972,83.52,47.38,22.69,25.55,28.59,27.16,83.95,60.08,48.35,8.33,5.25,1.44,0.41,0.21,1.54,0.93,3.09,15.02,9.16,2.16,13.27,7.72,2.57,6.48,1.03,13.68,5.14,4.12,5.76,1.85,1.13,2.88,11.93,0.51,11.42,2.37,1.13,2.26,1.95,0.21,4.42,0.62,3.09,1.65,1.23,0.51,0.1,0.21,0.1,0.1,0,0,14.61,5.25,0.51,0.1,1.23,0.21,2.57,7.51,0.82,0,0.93,1.34,4.84,4.63,0.21,0,3.09,0,0.41,2.26,0.1,0.41,1.13,0.21,0,0.1,0,0,0.72,0,0,0.72,0.31,0.72,0,0.31,0,0.21,0.51,0,3.29,7.61,0.62,0.93,5.25,1.13,0.1,0.21,3.4,4.12,2.57,1.65,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,17.08,3.7,7.2,0,0,1.44,4.73,0,0.51,0.1,0.21,0,0,3.49,3.54,3.15,3.43,2.68,-2.75,-1.96,-0.74,-1.51,-2.13,0.1,0.93,0.31,0.21,0.62,0.62,0.62,0,0.41,0,0.31,0.1,0.72,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.71,1.26,16.79,113.17,0.62,329.22,-0.93,144.03,0.82,102.88,0.82,133.74,-0.93,257.2,-0.72,360.08,0,133.74,-0.1,51.44,0.51,0,0,82.3,185.19,102.88,41.15,30.86,61.73,0.1,123.46,41.15,41.15,51.44,0,0,0,51.44,10.29,133.74,61.73,10.29,10.29,0.51,1,0.31,1.03,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.31,0.31,0.21,0,1

5/14/14,1,B,"CITY HALL - Equal rights, unequal reactions - Compromise suggested for city ordinance not enough for some GOP, faith leaders ","Mayor Annise Parker and supporters of her proposed nondiscrimination ordinance announced a compromise Tuesday in hopes of quelling a chorus of opposition from religious and conservative leaders who are against the city offering equal rights protections to gay, lesbian and transgender individuals.
It did not work, as more than 300 protesters gathered with clergy members and conservative activists outside City Hall an hour later to denounce the proposed ordinance as providing ""an opportunity for sexual predators to have access to our families.""
Most of the heated opposition stemmed from one paragraph in the 35-page proposal specifying that no business open to the public could deny a transgender person entry to a restroom consistent with his or her gender identity.
Council member Jerry Davis said he simply will ask his colleagues to remove it at Wednesday's council meeting. He said the compromise now makes him comfortable supporting the ordinance, adding to the tally of council members Parker can rely on when the item reaches a vote.
""We believe this will end some of the confusion,"" Davis said.
Republican political leaders and some clergy members have used the provision to dub the measure ""Parker's Sexual Predator Protection Act,"" suggesting it would allow people to lie about their gender to enter bathrooms where they could attack women and children.
Members of the gay, lesbian and transgender community were equally outraged that the provision would give businesses an out if they had a ""good faith belief"" that the person's claim of being transgender was disingenuous.
Maverick Welsh, president of the GLBT Political Caucus, stood with the mayor, Davis and religious and Democratic leaders to welcome the compromise.
""The ordinance will still protect transgender people,"" Welsh said. ""Discrimination is discrimination - whether it's a restroom, at a job, or somewhere else.""
Transgender people barred access to a restroom still would be able to file a discrimination complaint with the city's Office of Inspector General under the process outlined for all protected characteristics, such as race and veteran status.
Coalition of support
A coalition of 70 faith leaders wrote a letter supporting the ordinance and proposed compromise. Houston civil rights leader and Baptist minister Bill Lawson joined some of them at Tuesday's announcement, as did state Rep. Sylvester Turner and state Sen. Rodney Ellis, both Democrats of Houston.
""The base ordinance is still the same,"" Parker said. ""It says you can't discriminate."" The proposed measure would ban discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, family status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as federal laws do, and also would cover sexual orientation and gender identity.
Labeled 'smokescreen'
As drafted, it would extend to businesses with 50 or more workers, businesses that serve the public, housing, city employment and city contracting; religious institutions would be exempt. Violations would be civil misdemeanors, with fines capped at $5,000.
Council members offered a dozen amendments last week.
Some would tweak the provision Davis and the mayor now want to remove. Others want to expand the ordinance's reach by including businesses with more than 15 employees rather than 50.
Oliver Pennington, among other suggestions, is seeking to exempt all private businesses and some single-family home rentals or sales.
Most of the clergy members and GOP political leaders who rallied protesters Tuesday outside City Hall condemned the compromise as a ""smokescreen.""
""The real persons that are being discriminated against are standing here!"" shouted the Rev. Max Miller, president of the Baptist Ministers Association of Houston and Vicinity.
Children's safety cited
People cheered and waved Bibles as Miller and others argued the ordinance would restrict religious liberty, harm businesses and, even with the compromise, put children using public bathrooms at risk from sexual predators.
The Rev. F.M. Williams Sr. said the ordinance ""is not about civil rights. It's about immoral rights."" He held up a Bible and said, ""My contract says homosexuality is an abomination to God.""
State Rep. Dwayne Bohac, D-Houston, said he ""profoundly disagrees"" with the proposal, in part, because the religious exemption does not extend to business owners who would deny service because of personal beliefs, such as a florist refusing to provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. Bohac signed a letter of opposition with Houston-area Republican Reps. Bill Callegari, Allen Fletcher and Debbie Riddle.
Pledge to repeal
The Rev. Willie Davis lamented that the ordinance had divided Houston.
""We're here to unite the city,"" he said, gesturing to the crowd behind him.
The debate continued into the early evening at the City Council's public comment session, with more than 200 people signed up to speak.
Opponents said that if the council approves the ordinance, they will seek a ballot initiative to repeal it and remember it come election time.
Anna Eastman, a Houston Independent School District board member, said HISD already has an anti-discrimination policy that covers the same characteristics and includes ensuring bathroom access for transgender people.

5/4/14,1,B,"LETTERS - Appreciating teachers, students ","Magnet benefits
Regarding ""HISD looks at boosting pay of new teachers"" (Page B2, April 25), as a firm believer in the effectiveness of learning by doing and place-based education, I was disappointed to learn of HISD's proposal to terminate their fifth-grade Outdoor Education Center (OEC) magnet program.
Every week during the school year the four-decade-old OEC program takes fifth-grade students from elementary schools across HISD to camp facilities two hours north of Houston and teaches them about science, nature, report writing and other outdoor educational activities for four days and three nights.
The OEC program gets students excited about learning. By literally getting their hands dirty, maybe in the lake or in the garden, and doing things themselves, the students discover that learning can be more than just a classroom exercise. For many of the students the OEC program may be the first time that they have been outside of Houston, and it also may be the first time they have been away from their parents or guardians for an extended period. They gain valuable self- confidence from this.
HISD has been at the leading edge of public education with its magnet programs, and the OEC has provided generations of Houston students with a unique, memorable and horizon-expanding educational experience. I urge HISD not to shut down the OEC.
David Wood, Houston Life learning
Regarding ""HISD teacher suit could impact nation"" (Page A1, Friday), I strongly believe that the evaluation of teachers should not be based primarily on the student's test scores, especially if society itself has pushed and allowed students to get away with misbehavior and disrespectful attitude toward them.
For as much passion that a teacher has toward his or her profession, if the students do not wish to learn and do their best in school, it is not the fault of the educators.
It is also unfortunate that some students don't want to attend school because that attitude affects those who genuinely want to learn. A classroom should be a place to continue learning for students and school faculty; it should not feel like a battle between those who behave and those who disrupt education. If the overall evaluation depends on the ambition and success of the students, there is just so much a teacher can achieve.
Instead of looking at the scores and evaluating school professionals through this, we should look at our children and determine why they get the grades they get, then promote education as a way of life.
Ana K. Kiaz, Hitchcock Teacher pay
Rather than issue a memo or press release full of platitudes for Teacher Appreciation Week (May 5-9), HISD should demonstrate its commitment to teachers by developing a teacher evaluation and compensation system that recognizes and supports them as the professionals they are. This would include a salary scale and structure that encourages the best and brightest new teachers to apply to HISD and our experienced teachers to stay in HISD rather than flee to suburban districts with higher and more stable salaries and less challenging students.
It would also include an evaluation system based on administrator observation and feedback on actual teaching throughout the year rather than the test scores of students on a single day, a practice that has been shown to be inaccurate, inconsistent and especially unfair to the teachers of our most challenging students.
We need practices that build professional learning communities in our schools, not practices that promote constant turnover, competition, fear and flight.
Debora Banner, Houston
...
Needed measure
Regarding ""Houston Partnership backs equal-rights measure"" (Page B1, Wednesday), I know people who have been fired because they are gay. In fact, one of my students just got fired about a month ago because she advocated for the gay community.
While other identities are protected, many of which are protected at the federal level, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression are not protected at the federal, state or local level. That is why we need the Houston equal-rights ordinance.
Maria Gonzalez, posted on HoustonChronicle.com Don't blame the GOP
Regarding ""Surge of Latino voters stagnates under state GOP's policies"" (Page B13, April 27), Latinos should look beyond the Democratic Party and stop blaming Republican Party policies for lower voter turnouts.
Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, D-San Antonio, makes a lot of statements about what troubles the Latino Texan, but fails to provide one single solution, other than more government involvement in our lives.
The absurdity that the GOP wants to keep Latinos uneducated, in bad health and poor is laughable. Nothing is farther from the truth. By making that statement he endorses the Democratic Party as the panacea for what troubles Latinos.
He cites that Texas government has been controlled by the GOP since 1994 and that that is the root cause for all our problems. That is pure nonsense.
For the record, the Democratic Party had a majority in both houses of the Legislature, the Supreme Court and the governor's mansion for 88 years of the 100 years of the 20th century. The same injustices Martinez Fischer is now laying at the feet of the GOP could have been easily addressed and corrected by the Democrats during that long period.
Martinez Fischer is a member of the Texas Legislature. He does not mention his party's failure of Latinos but now conveniently singles out the GOP as the root cause for what ails Latinos.
During those 88 years, we have had low high-school graduation levels, high unemployment, poor-paying jobs, low voter turnout and many other issues. These problems are not a new phenomenon.
I will offer suggestions to improve our lot: Stop the constant whining. Get an education. Get off the couch and vote. The opportunities are there. Take them.

5/5/14,1,Editorial ,Editorial: Ballot blues ,"
It‚Äôs not difficult to imagine how disappointed Nathan Mathis must have been last week when the Alabama Democratic Party blocked his access to its ticket in his run for the District 29 state senate seat.
‚ÄúThey said they had some kind of rule,‚Äù Mathis told the Eagle later. ‚ÄúYou and I would call it a ‚Äòcome and kiss the ring‚Äô rule.‚Äù
Having served as a Democrat over the majority of his long political career ‚Äì he‚Äôs served on the county commission and spent several terms in the state House of Representatives ‚Äì Mathis mounted a campaign for Houston County Commission in 2012 as a Republican, as the race would be decided in the GOP primary.
Considering that in Alabama the GOP was the outlier party until after 1986, when Guy Hunt became the first Republican governor since Reconstruction, the current political climate suggests that running as a Democrat would hobble a middle-of-the-road conservative. After all, no Democrats hold statewide office in Alabama today.
However, political parties control their ballots and the state Democrats are well within their rights to deny Mathis for his turn as a Republican just as the GOP stripped incumbent Sen. Harri Anne Smith of her Republican label for having supported then- Congressman Bobby Bright, a Democrat, over Republican Jay Love, who defeated her in an acrimonious party primary for the same seat.
Perhaps party committees have too much control over the electoral process when they can hamstring long-serving candidates like Mathis and Smith should they choose strategy or conscience over blind loyalty. Then again, the parties operate their own primaries, and candidates are well aware of the bylaws and the consequences of breaking them.
Ultimately, elections are decided by voters. A hopeful candidate without party backing can, with some added difficulty, proceed as an independent. And it‚Äôs possible to win without major party backing, as Smith proved following her exile from the GOP fold.",Campaign for Houston ,1,316,84.51,60.76,12.23,74.54,24.31,26.9,85.44,60.44,48.42,7.91,6.01,0.32,0,0.32,2.53,2.53,1.9,16.46,10.13,1.27,14.87,6.65,4.43,8.54,0.63,12.34,6.01,3.16,10.13,3.16,0.63,6.01,12.97,0.63,11.71,2.85,1.58,2.85,1.27,0.95,2.85,0,7.28,5.38,1.9,1.27,0.63,0.63,0,0.32,0.32,0,12.97,6.01,0.63,0,0.32,0.32,1.27,6.96,0,0,0.95,1.9,10.44,10.44,0,0,6.33,2.53,0,3.48,0.32,0,0.95,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.63,0,3.48,6.65,0.32,1.27,4.75,0.63,0,0,5.06,5.06,2.85,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,13.29,4.11,4.75,0,0,1.27,3.16,0,1.27,0,0,0,0.32,2.28,3.07,2.93,2.98,2.2,-1.42,0.35,1.71,1,0.46,0,1.27,0.32,0,0.32,0,0.32,0,0.95,0,0,0,0.95,0.32,0.63,0,0,0,0,0,0.32,0.32,0,0,2.59,1.51,23.11,158.23,0,253.16,0.63,189.87,0.95,253.16,2.53,221.52,-0.95,411.39,2.53,379.75,0,727.85,0.63,0,0,0,0,63.29,158.23,284.81,0,0,94.94,0.32,158.23,63.29,31.65,63.29,0,0,0,31.65,0,63.29,31.65,31.65,0,0.95,1,0,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

6/12/14,2,Star,Commentary - Weighing difference between 'No limits' and 'Without limits' ,"In 1975, NBC, the television network, spent $1 million on designing a new logo.
It was nothing fancy, just a big capital ""N.""
Hard to believe NBC spent that much on a letter that's worth only one point in Scrabble.
A new logo is a huge deal to a major corporation.
Turns out, NBC's new logo was virtually identical to the logo used by Nebraska's PBS stations.
Naturally, Nebraska PBS sued NBC. When the dust - and an out-of-court settlement - cleared, NBC gave Nebraska PBS about $800,000 worth of new equipment.
Let's cut NBC some slack - 1976 was pre-Internet. The network couldn't do a Google search and see that its new logo was already somebody's old logo.
Here comes the Greater Houston Partnership's new image campaign for Houston - with the slogan ""Houston: The City With No Limits,"" a splashy video with the theme song ""Best Day of My Life"" and an optical-illusion logo. Concentrate, squint ... there it is, the letter H!
The partnership took more than a year to develop this campaign, with input from the mayor's office, the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, multinational corporations, community leaders and local chambers of commerce. Two Texas marketing agencies ""conducted extensive market and brand research, created the brand architecture and developed the creative elements.""
I wonder if they Googled to see if another city already was using the ""no limits"" bit. Danger, Will Robinson!
Killeen adopted the slogan ""A City Without Limits"" in 2004. (The home to Fort Hood added a second slogan, ""Where Freedom Grows,"" in 2008.)
""No Limits"" ... ""Without Limits"" ... as children say, same difference.
And the song, ""Best Day of My Life"" is featured in TV commercials for Lowe's home handyman stores.
Maybe we should be thankful that the Greater Houston Partnership didn't decide to call Houston ... ""Bean City"" or ""The Large Easy."" Or pick ""I Wish I Was an Oscar Meyer Weiner"" for our theme song.

Did you notice that the ""H"" in our new ""City With No Limits"" is made up entirely of negative space? In the graphic design world, negative space is the white space where no color or design is present. Subtext: Houston: Limitless negative space. Maybe that Austin creative firm just stared out of the window while they were stuck in traffic, sweating to death. Laughing with you. John LaCarter, Houston
I don't understand the need to sell Houston. There are already more people than the roads can handle. When is enough, enough? We are busting at the seams. I am glad there are people willing to shovel snow. We are full! I prefer the message be ""Houston is a mosquito-infested swamp. Stay where you are!"" Regards,
Patrick Haussler, Houston
The Greater Houston Partnership's campaign hopes to lure businesses to move here and convince young professionals to live here. Houston needs more people and a greater tax base so it can raise money to fill potholes and repair streets ... which are already clogged, and more businesses and people will clog them even more.
As Jerry Seinfeld says, good luck with all that.
I don't know what the attendance was at the Art Car Parade, but you can't compare it to the Thanksgiving Day parade. People lined the streets from Waugh, through downtown, and back. Maybe the guy operating the drone could make a guess.
Have you ridden in one of the cars before? It is astounding. You are welcome to ride in my car at the parade next year. It's called Texas Natives.
Chris Greene, Houston
I wasn't knocking the Art Car Parade. I just rolled my eyes at organizers claiming that 315,000 people attended. I like and support the event.
And I'll take you up on that offer to ride in your car next year. But 315,000 is just a ridiculous figure.
Also, it's a city regulation that event organizers must provide one portable toilet for every 300 people they expect.

7/4/14,3,A,Foes of rights ordinance submit repeal petitions ,"Opponents of Houston's new non-discrimination ordinance Thursday turned in well more than the minimum number of signatures needed to trigger a November vote on whether to repeal the measure.
Staff in the City Secretary's office will have 30 days to verify that the names - 50,000 of them, opponents said - cross the minimum threshold of 17,269 signatures from registered Houston voters that foes needed to gather in the month following the measure's passage in an 11-6 vote of the City Council.
Most of the divisiveness around the ordinance stems from the protections it extends to gay and transgender residents, groups not already protected under federal laws barring discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
Mayor Annise Parker pledged to fight the effort to overturn the ordinance should it make the November ballot, a task she acknowledged city rules make fairly easy.
""This was not a narrowly focused, special interest ordinance,"" said Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city. ""This is something that the business and civic community of Houston was firmly behind, and we fully expect if there is a campaign that it will be a spirited campaign, but we'll have the same outcome in November as we had around the council table.
""Houston does not discriminate, Houston will not discriminate and Houston will not be fooled by misinformation, hyperbole - I would use the word 'lies' but I'm going to back off from that - and people who are just simply unwilling to read the ordinance for themselves.""
All eyes on Houston
Dueling Thursday news conferences by the foes of the ordinance - a small group of conservative political and faith leaders - and supporters - a crowd of citizens, pastors and nonprofit leaders wearing red - highlighted the emotions that have marked the debate for months.
Each side observed the other's media announcement, with some opponents' interruptions prompting Parker to warn that they risked being escorted out.
The proposal spurred numerous marathon meetings of City Council, at which supporters shared tearful experiences of discrimination and stressed that the eyes of the world were watching; opponents, some of them irate, invoked the gaze of God and vengeful voters.
""It has been shown and demonstrated that the people of the city do not want this ordinance,"" said the Rev. Max Miller, of the Baptist Ministers Association of Houston and Vicinity, claiming a poll opponents conducted showed 82 percent of voters opposed. ""We simply say: Allow the people to vote on this ordinance.""
'Strange obsession'
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
Again Thursday, Miller referenced opponents' central bugaboo regarding the ordinance, the perceived threat of male sexual predators dressed in drag entering women's restrooms, saying, ""We're standing up to protect our women and our children."" Foes have dubbed the measure the ""Sexual Predator Protection Act.""
The ordinance protects transgender residents' ability to use the restroom consistent with their gender expression, regardless of their biological sex, but puts the onus on the individual to prove he or she was a victim of discrimination.
Parker, clearly exasperated, decried opponents' ""mystifying"" and ""strange obsession"" with where transgender men and women use the bathroom.
""It is illegal today to go into a place of public accommodation for the intent of committing a crime. It was illegal before, it's going to be illegal after,"" Parker said.
'The world is changing'
Opponent Dave Welch of the Houston Area Pastor Council said his side is confident leading into the possible fall referendum campaign.
""With a very difficult process in place required to gather these signatures - you have to be a registered voter to gather, every sheet has to be notarized - we still gathered over 50,000 in 30 days,"" Welch said. ""That's pretty impressive, and it shows the nature of what the citizens believe about this ordinance. That speaks well, we believe, to this fall.""
Parker also expressed confidence that the measure would withstand a test at the ballot box, though she acknowledged business leaders have expressed concern about whether Houston's image could take a hit if outsiders perceive the city as fighting over whether to allow discrimination.
""I have every expectation that this petition drive will be defeated, if they have sufficient signatures, in November, then we will have shown that Houston does not support discrimination,"" Parker said.
""I have every expectation that this is an ordinance that will live in Houston for many years to come and make Houston a better place in which to live.""
Houston voters twice have rejected protections or benefits for gay Americans at the ballot box, in 1985 and in 2001, though Parker said, ""The world is changing on this issue.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,807,87.53,61.41,22.07,10.42,26.9,29.37,83.77,57.5,46.84,8.3,3.47,0.5,1.24,0.12,0.62,0.87,4.83,14.87,9.42,1.49,13.88,7.06,3.1,5.33,0.87,12.76,4.83,2.97,6.69,2.11,0.74,3.97,9.67,0.5,9.05,0.99,1.98,0.99,1.24,0.99,3.47,0,3.84,1.36,2.35,1.12,0.37,0.62,0.12,0.37,0.12,0,14.37,6.32,0.12,0.12,1.98,0,1.86,7.06,0.37,0,0.87,0.5,3.22,2.97,0.25,0,4.34,0,0.37,2.97,0.37,0.99,1.86,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.99,0,0,0.62,0.12,0.62,0,0.25,0,0.12,1.24,0.25,4.21,9.17,0.74,1.24,6.57,1.12,0,0,2.73,2.85,2.48,2.6,0,0,0,0,0,18.96,3.72,7.19,0,0,2.6,5.45,0,0.12,0,0.37,0,0,3.75,3.85,3.43,3.61,3.15,-3.5,-2.12,-0.85,-1.87,-2.44,0.74,0.62,0.25,0.5,0.12,0.87,0.62,0.12,0.99,0.37,0.62,0.25,0.62,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,1.48,19.67,86.74,0.37,396.53,-2.6,136.31,1.24,210.66,1.98,198.27,-0.99,260.22,0.25,371.75,0,99.13,-0.25,99.13,0.99,24.78,0,136.31,123.92,74.35,24.78,12.39,99.13,0,185.87,99.13,24.78,12.39,24.78,0.25,0,111.52,0,136.31,86.74,0,0,1.36,1,0.62,1.49,0,0.12,0,0,0.25,0,0.62,0.25,0.37,0,1
7/25/14,3,Local News,Discrimination based on sexual orientation: A look at the law ,"
It would be illegal for the organization to fire someone for being a man, for being a Christian or because he is Caucasian. Firing someone for being gay, however, doesn‚Äôt break any laws at the local, state or federal level.
‚ÄúI think that a lot of people think that because we all deserve a fair shake at work that it must be illegal to discriminate against somebody because he is gay. That‚Äôs not true,‚Äù said Rebecca Robertson, legal and policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.
And, even though there is protection in some areas of the country, many of those laws have religious exemptions, she said.
‚ÄúSo, no matter where somebody works, there is always a risk that they could get fired for being gay or lesbian and the employer could just say it point blank. There would not be any legal recourse,‚Äù Rebecca Robertson said.
Houston is the most recent Texas city to pass a municipal ordinance addressing the issue, after Mayor Annise Parker ‚Äî the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city ‚Äî led the charge.
The approval was greeted with thunderous applause from the audience, largely full of supporters, and chants of ‚ÄúHERO,‚Äù for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, according to the Houston Chronicle.
However, the ordinance passed in May is being challenged in court, Rebecca Robertson said.
At the national level, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama Monday addresses the issue, but only impacts employees of companies with federal contracting work.
‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people,‚Äù Obama said at a signing ceremony from the White House East Room. He said it‚Äôs unacceptable that being gay is still a firing offense in most places in the United States, according to a report by the Associated Press.
The president also noted that more states allow same-sex marriage than prohibit gay discrimination in hiring.
Until last month, Obama long resisted pressure to pursue an executive anti-discrimination order covering federal contractors in the hope that Congress would take more sweeping action banning anti-gay workplace discrimination across America, according to the AP.
A bill to accomplish that goal ‚Äî the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ‚Äî passed the Senate last year with some Republican support, but has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled House. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to do what we can to make it right,‚Äù Obama said in the AP report.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,399,84.34,45.98,12.5,30.46,23.47,25.56,83.46,61.65,49.37,7.27,2.26,0.25,0.75,0,1,0.25,5.01,15.79,10.03,0.25,13.03,8.52,4.01,5.01,1.5,13.78,7.77,4.26,10.28,1.75,1.5,7.02,12.53,0.75,11.78,0.5,1.75,2.76,3.01,0.5,4.26,0,3.26,2.01,1.25,0.5,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,11.53,5.01,0.25,0.25,1,0.75,2.51,6.27,0.25,0,0.75,1,5.26,4.01,1.25,0,6.52,0,1,4.76,0.25,0.5,1.75,0,0,0,0,0,1.75,0,0,0,0.25,0.75,0.25,0.25,0,0.25,0.5,0,4.01,9.02,0,1.5,6.77,0.5,0.25,0,2.26,3.26,3.51,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,16.04,4.26,6.77,0,0,1.25,3.76,0,0.25,0,0,0,0.25,3.59,4.3,3.11,3.7,2.8,-3.98,-1.57,-0.94,-1.9,-1.79,0.25,0.5,0,0,1.25,1,1,0,1.25,0.5,0.75,0,1,0,0.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.61,0.84,22.61,100.25,0.75,476.19,0.25,175.44,1.75,150.38,1.25,100.25,-1,250.63,0.75,551.38,0,125.31,0.5,100.25,1,0,0,275.69,250.63,150.38,75.19,0,75.19,0.25,250.63,25.06,75.19,25.06,25.06,0.25,0,100.25,0,325.81,200.5,25.06,25.06,1.5,1,0.73,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.73,1.21,0,0,1
9/11/14,3,Policy & Issues,Council passes Buffalo Speedway extension and Water Conservation Plan ,"Play
P { margin-bottom: 0.08in; }A:link { }
On Wednesday, September 10, Houston City Council may have completed its consent agenda in record time, passing all 24 items unanimously and without a single tag in about 3 minutes and 20 seconds, not including the monthly financial reports of the Comptroller and Finance Director. Most of the items were routine matters such as setting rental rates and hearing dates, abandoning sewer easements, accepting grants, and approving TIRZ budgets. However, 2 issues could have a noticeable long-term impact for Houston residents. Item 18 was approval of a state-mandated revised water conservation plan. Item 20 approved acquisition of rights of way for extending Buffalo Speedway from West Belfort to West Airport Road.
State law requires cities to establish a comprehensive Water Conservation Plan and update it every years. The Houston plan includes outlines for establishing priorities for maintaining and improving pipelines, revising the drought ordinance, and establishing public awareness campaigns. Ms. Emily Seldonridge of the Galveston Bay Foundation spoke in favor of the plan at the Public Speakers session on Tuesday. Mayor Parker further explained the Conservation Plan at her press conference. The extension of Buffalo Speedway to West Airport Road is much needed and long awaited project that will provide an alternate route toward Hobby Airport. The project is in District K, represented by Council Member Larry Green. He outlined some of the legal challenges the City had to overcome in acquiring the rights of way during the ""popoff"" session.
Mayor Parker held her press conference in the rotunda, joined by Houston Public Library Director Dr. Rhea Lawson Brown and H-E- B Vice President Winell Herron to launch a campaign for Houston residents to sign up for a new My Link Houston Library Card. The new cards will update access to the HPL collection of 6 million works including 130 electronic databases of on-line resources. H-E-B helped sponsor the cost of the upgrade and will promote the campaign at its stores and with advertisements such as its My Link ads on delivery trucks.",Campaign for Houston ,1,340,98.26,45.28,20.25,61.89,22.67,33.24,75,47.35,36.76,2.94,1.47,0.59,0,0,0.88,0,1.47,13.53,8.53,3.82,15,3.53,0.88,4.41,0.29,7.94,5.88,3.53,8.24,0.88,2.94,4.41,5.88,0.59,5.29,2.06,0.29,0.59,0.29,0,0.88,0,3.24,2.94,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.06,3.24,0.59,0.29,0,0,0.59,2.65,0,0,0.88,0.29,2.65,2.06,0,0.59,8.24,0.59,0.59,5.29,1.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,1.47,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,3.24,8.24,0.29,0.59,6.47,0.59,0.29,0,4.41,4.12,1.47,2.65,0.29,0.29,0.29,0,0,13.82,5.29,3.53,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.06,3.15,2.69,3.03,2.24,-0.68,-0.44,0.46,-0.55,-1.64,0.29,0,0.29,0,0.88,0,0,0,0.59,0,0,0,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.97,0.44,13.88,117.65,1.18,147.06,0.29,205.88,1.47,147.06,1.47,117.65,-0.59,0,0,352.94,0,147.06,-0.59,0,0,0,0,0,176.47,58.82,29.41,29.41,58.82,0.29,58.82,29.41,29.41,29.41,0,0,0,117.65,29.41,117.65,0,0,0,0.29,1,0,1.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

8/8/14,4,B,CITY HALL - Equal rights ordinance stalled at hearing - City's LGBT measure postponed until Aug. 15 for clarity ,"Conservative activists seeking to repeal the Houston equal rights ordinance trumpeted a small victory Thursday when a court hearing resulted in the ordinance being suspended pending an Aug. 15 hearing.
Mayor Annise Parker, anticipating a lawsuit, had already said she would not enforce the ordinance until there was more legal clarity, but plaintiff and conservative activist Jared Woodfill said Thursday's result was important.
""I think it makes a big difference because now you have a court order saying you can't enforce it, even if you change your mind and you wanted to,"" Woodfill said.
Woodfill characterized the suspension as having been ordered by visiting State District Judge Jeff Shadwick, a suggestion that prompted a chuckle from City Attorney David Feldman.
""This is not the judge ordering us, this is the city stipulating that it would not enforce, consistent with the mayor's public representation,"" he said.
Opponents had sought an injunction to force the city to block the ordinance and trigger the process of placing a repeal vote on the November ballot.
The court development followed a Thursday morning decision by a federal judge - to whom city attorneys had transferred the lawsuit - to kick the fight back to state court. Foes had called the move to federal court a delay tactic.
Woodfill and three others sued Parker and city officials on Tuesday, a day after Feldman announced the ordinance foes had failed to gather enough valid signatures to force a repeal referendum.
The opponents' suit claims Feldman illegally inserted himself into the petition verification process, throwing out entire pages of signatures based on notary and signature-gathering mistakes.
City Council approved the ordinance in May, banning discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in- housing and in-city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt.
Opponents disliked protections extended to gay and transgender residents, groups not already protected under federal discrimination laws, and promised to send the issue to the voters.
On July 3, they delivered what they said was more than 50,000 signatures to the city secretary's office, but Feldman and Parker on Monday announced the petition was 2,000 valid signatures short of the 17,269-signature threshold needed to force a vote after most of the pages contained mistakes that invalidated the entire page of signatures.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,377,92.16,47.93,13.08,14.43,25.13,32.1,77.98,52.79,41.91,6.37,3.45,0.27,0.27,1.33,0.8,0.53,2.92,14.59,11.41,1.86,10.88,5.31,1.59,5.57,1.33,10.88,5.04,3.18,6.37,0.27,0.53,5.84,10.61,0,10.34,0.53,2.92,1.86,0.53,0.27,3.45,0,2.65,1.06,1.59,0.53,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,11.14,5.04,0,0,1.33,0.8,2.12,4.77,0,0,0.27,0.53,3.71,3.71,0,0,2.65,0,0.53,1.86,0.27,0.27,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0,0.27,0.27,0.53,0.53,0.27,0,0,1.06,0,1.86,6.63,0.53,0.53,5.04,0,0.53,0,4.77,6.9,1.59,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,13.53,3.98,5.57,0,0,1.33,2.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.78,4.54,3.52,4.41,2.97,-4.6,-2.95,-2.61,-2.36,-3.35,1.06,0,0,0.27,0.8,0.53,0.27,0,1.33,0,0.27,0,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.73,1.34,16.03,265.25,1.86,132.63,0,212.2,1.59,159.15,1.33,79.58,0.27,212.2,-0.27,530.5,0,106.1,0.27,79.58,0.8,0,0,79.58,291.78,79.58,26.53,79.58,0,0,159.15,53.05,0,0,0,0,0,79.58,79.58,26.53,53.05,0,0,0.53,1,0.53,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.27,0.27,0,1
8/7/14,4,B,City of Houston - Bias-law foes rip move of case to U.S. court ,"Conservative activists seeking to repeal Houston's equal rights ordinance accused the city of stalling the issue Wednesday after city lawyers moved the opponents' lawsuit over rejected ballot petitions from state to federal court.
Opponents blasted the move, calling it a delay tactic aimed at keeping the issue off the November ballot. City officials called it a routine move invited by the plaintiffs' decision to cite federal law in their suit.
Critics of the new equal rights ordinance sued the mayor and city officials Tuesday, one day after City Attorney David Feldman announced that opponents had failed to gather enough valid signatures to force a repeal referendum. Opponents claim Feldman illegally inserted himself into the petition verification process, throwing out entire pages of signatures based on notary and signature- gathering mistakes.
Feldman and Mayor Annise Parker said Wednesday that the opponents' court filing offered grounds to move the case to federal court by claiming the petition rejections ""stripped these Plaintiffs from their right to petition government for a redress of their grievances"" under city charter and state and federal laws.
Plaintiff Jared Woodfill, a conservative activist, said the city's move was less about federal rights and more about putting off a ruling. Woodfill and opponents sought an injunction in state court Tuesday night, asking visiting state District Judge John Coselli to suspend enforcement of the ordinance, effectively triggering the referendum process. Parker, however, already has said the city will not enforce the ordinance until there is a legal ruling.
Coselli did not rule on the injunction request Tuesday, and by Wednesday afternoon the city had filed its notice of removal.
""They're doing everything they can to keep the people and the courts from ruling on this,"" Woodfill said.
Gay, transgender rights
Opponents largely take issue with the rights the ordinance extends to gay and transgender residents, groups not already protected under federal laws barring discrimination.
City Council approved the so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance on an 11-6 vote in May, banning discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
Opponents promised to send the issue to the voters, and on July 3, they delivered what they said was more than 50,000 signatures to the city secretary's office.
Feldman and Parker on Monday announced that opponents fell about 2,000 valid signatures short of the 17,269-signature threshold needed to place the repeal issue on the November ballot.
The process was twofold. City Secretary Anna Russell first started going through individual signatures on the petition pages, checking to see whether people who signed were registered Houston voters. Her initial count reported 17,846 valid signatures, enough to get the repeal referendum on the ballot.
Because the rules for repealing a city ordinance are more stringent than those for amending the city charter, however, there are additional requirements when it comes to petitions. Feldman and his staff threw out more than half the 5,199 pages opponents submitted, saying they contained mistakes that invalidated the entire page of signatures. Among those mistakes were instances in which the signature-gatherer was not a registered Houston voter or who did not sign the petition, as required by the city charter.
Ordinance opponents say Russell's initial count was the most important and it should immediately have validated their petition. City attorneys disagree, saying Russell ultimately found there were not enough signatures.
During her weekly news conference after Wednesday's City Council meeting, Parker referred to a training video that shows Dave Welch - with the Houston Area Pastor Council and a leading opponent of the ordinance - explaining the rules signature-gatherers needed to follow. With a PowerPoint presentation behind him, Welch tells the audience the unique repeal referendum process ""makes it more challenging for us.""
Welch's video 'amusing'
Signature gatherers must be registered city voters, Welch said. If they are not, the entire page gets thrown out.
Parker said she had not seen the video but that her staff had been ""enjoying"" it.
""So, it's kind of amusing if, in fact, his own language is used against him in court,"" Parker said.
Welch said using the language in the video to undermine the opponents' case is ""apples to oranges.""
""Ultimately, what matters is not what I say in a video,"" he said. ""We believe that it's not Feldman's role to step in like he did. We believe the courts will uphold that.""

The lawsuit asks a state district judge to declare that City Secretary Anna Russell met her legal duty by verifying a sufficient number of signatures to force a vote, only to have City Attorney David Feldman illegally insert himself into verifying the petition, invalidating more than half of the petition's 5,200 pages for failing to satisfy legal requirements in the city charter. That left opponents roughly 2,000 names short of the 17,269-signature threshold needed to force a referendum.
In a memo to Mayor Annise Parker and the City Council, Russell said she had found 17,846 valid signatures before Feldman reviewed the pages, and attributed the lower count to her review of his office's work. At an injunction hearing Tuesday night, plaintiffs argued Russell's initial count was the important one by law and should have triggered a referendum. City attorneys disagreed, saying Russell ultimately found there were not enough signatures.
""If he (Feldman) felt there were underlying problems with the petition then he, like us, has the right to file a lawsuit if he doesn't agree with what the city secretary did,"" said conservative activist Jared Woodfill, one of the four plaintiffs. ""Going in before she's ever made the decision and influencing her is inappropriate, it's illegal and we believe the court will agree with us and that folks will have their voices heard in November on this issue.""
Ruling Wednesday?
Visiting Judge John Coselli did not rule on the plaintiffs' injunction request. The judge indicated he could rule as early as Wednesday morning.
Feldman strongly disputed the idea that his involvement crossed ethical or legal lines, saying he has a specific duty under city ordinance to interpret the law and give legal advice.
""There's nothing that would preclude me from giving legal advice to the city secretary,"" Feldman said. ""In fact, that's what our ordinances would expect me to do: Give advice to her on an issue which is really a legal issue. The question of whether or not those pages are valid because of the issue of meeting or not meeting the requirements of the charter is a legal issue.""
City Council approved the so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance on an 11-6 vote in May, banning discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
The measure's divisiveness stems from the protections it extends to gay and transgender residents, groups not already protected under federal laws barring discrimination.
Opponents promised to send the issue to the voters, and on July 3, they claimed to have delivered more than 50,000 signatures - 31,000 of them verified, they said - to the city secretary's office.
In Tuesday's filing, opponents sought a declaration that their petition is valid and contains the needed number of signatures. They also claim none of the ""so-called problems"" Feldman identified should have rendered Russell's initial count moot.
The mayor, the City of Houston and Russell are listed as defendants. Conservative activists Woodfill and Steve Hotze are joined as plaintiffs by pastors Max Miller and F.N. Williams. A spokeswoman for Parker pointed to a Monday press release issued after the petition was rejected.
""I fully expect the petitioners will want to fight this decision at the courthouse,"" the statement said. ""I am confident the courts will agree that the rules set out in our Charter and state law to protect the integrity of the process should be followed and that the results of our review will be upheld. The judicial review will provide additional assurance to the voters that the process has been fair.""
A very high bar
Opponents faced an unusually high and technical bar to gather enough signatures. For petitions seeking to repeal a city ordinance, all the signatures on a page are thrown out if the circulators who collected those signatures or the notaries who signed off on the page made a mistake.
Feldman and his staff threw out more than half the 5,199 pages, containing about 16,000 signatures ‚Äì many of them likely valid. Most pages were thrown out because those who collected names for the petition were not registered Houston voters or did not sign the petition themselves. Those errors invalidated more than 2,000 pages with about 11,300 signatures.
The city charter provision regarding attempts to repeal an ordinance hasn't come up since a 1996 repeal effort over affirmative action, officials said. The city has mostly dealt with petitions to amend the city charter, which require only the verification of whether the signatures belong to registered Houston voters.
Russell, who has worked for the city more than six decades, said earlier Tuesday that she could not recall another instance in which city attorneys reviewed the pages of a petition. However, she said, the petition process to overturn an ordinance is unusual in itself because other petition processes do not require that each page be notarized.
Bob Stein, a political science professor at Rice University, said the city's process for repeal referendums is likely to come up in court. ""The real question is whether or not you can invalidate a signature because it happens to be on a page that is invalidated,"" he said. ""This is going to be an issue of voter's rights.""
Opponents are asking the judge to suspend enforcement of the ordinance, triggering the referendum process. Parker has already said she will wait to enforce the ordinance until there's legal clarity.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,941,89.23,41.94,20.61,15.48,21.88,28.16,79.91,58.77,47.82,7.86,4.46,0.43,0.64,0.11,2.02,0.85,3.4,16.26,10.73,2.13,13.6,7.55,2.02,5.63,1.49,13.07,5.31,3.61,6.06,0.85,0.43,4.78,11.48,0.43,10.52,1.91,1.49,1.49,1.81,0.74,3.83,0.11,2.13,0.85,1.28,0.32,0.21,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,13.6,6.38,0.32,0.21,1.06,0.85,2.98,5.31,0.11,0,1.06,1.06,2.44,2.34,0,0.11,3.4,0,0.21,2.98,0.11,0.21,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0,0.64,0.21,0.43,0.43,0.43,0,0,0.53,0.21,2.23,7.86,0.43,0.96,6.48,0,0.21,0.11,3.51,5.21,4.04,1.49,0.32,0,0.32,0,0,14.67,4.57,5.1,0.11,0,1.91,2.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.18,3.6,3.09,3.73,2.64,-3.22,-2.05,-0.68,-1.28,-1.84,0.53,0,0,0.11,0.96,0.21,0.32,0,0.74,0.11,0.11,0,1.59,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.21,0.85,16.33,127.52,0.53,244.42,1.59,106.27,0.64,233.79,2.23,74.39,-0.53,170.03,0.11,393.2,0,95.64,-0.11,10.63,0.11,10.63,0,42.51,265.67,53.13,74.39,10.63,85.02,0.21,148.78,31.88,10.63,42.51,10.63,0.11,0,53.13,85.02,63.76,21.25,0,0,1.17,1,0.21,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0.11,0.11,0,1
8/5/14,4,A,"City's rights ordinance fight not over - After signatures for repeal vote fall short, foes vow to take battle to court ","Accusing the Parker administration of not respecting the rights of voters, opponents of Houston's new nondiscrimination ordinance pledged Monday to move their fight from the streets to the courts after the mayor and city attorney announced that foes had failed to gather enough valid signatures to force a repeal referendum on the November ballot.
Parker and City Attorney David Feldman said opponents of the measure gathered enough raw signatures to cross the minimum required threshold of 17,269 - 10 percent of the ballots cast in the last mayoral election - but that thousands of those signatures were on pages that were not collected in keeping with legal standards set forth in the city charter and had to be discarded.
Only 47 percent of the 5,199 pages submitted were valid, Feldman said, leaving opponents 2,020 names short of the requirement.
""There are simply too many documents with irregularities and problems to overlook,"" Feldman said. ""The petition is simply invalid. There is no other conclusion.""
The City Council approved the so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance on an 11-6 vote in May, banning discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
The measure's divisiveness stems from the protections it extends to gay and transgender residents, groups not already protected under federal laws barring discrimination on the basis of such things as sex, race, age, religion and disability.
Opponents promised to send the issue to the voters, and on July 3 , they claimed to have delivered more than 50,000 signatures - 31,000 of them verified, they said - to the city secretary's office.
Dave Welch of the Houston Area Pastors Council, who helped lead the petition effort, decried the mayor's announcement Monday and promised swift legal action.
""We were well aware we were dealing with an administration that's willing to bend the rules,"" Welch said. ""Courts typically uphold the rights of the voters. We feel very confident in how that will go. Frankly, there was no respect for the rights of the voters in this process.""
Parker 'confident'
Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city, said she also is confident the city will prevail in a court challenge. She noted that the last time such an ordinance repeal was attempted, in 1996 over affirmative action, hundreds of pages were thrown out after similar failings.
""I'm confident the courts will agree with the strict interpretation of rules set out in the charter for the requirements and that the courts will protect the integrity of our petition process,"" she said.
Key issues with the petition, Feldman said, were that those who collected names for the petition often were not registered Houston voters or did not sign the petition themselves, invalidating all the signatures they had gathered.
Others, he said, did not have each page properly notarized, another requirement. Welch was skeptical of Feldman's claims about those who circulated the petition for his group.
""Well, certainly we know that the vast majority of them were, in fact, residents and those that were involved within our churches; we know where they are from,"" he said. ""But we didn't control everything that everyone did, of course.""
Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who championed the measure on council, said Monday's announcement marked an important moment for supporters of gay rights.
""I respect the democratic process, so I'll respect whatever the courts rule,"" Cohen said. 'It is what it is'
The mayor declined to detail her personal feelings on the petition's apparent failure, instead pointing to the inevitable court fight ahead. Parker said she will delay enforcement of the ordinance until there is more legal clarity.
""It is what it is,"" she said. ""As I've said throughout this process, I fully expected there would be legal pressure from one side or the other, however the issue came out. I fully expected it to end up on a ballot, and we would win. If it does not wind up on a ballot, it saves the city a significant amount of money and effort mounting a legal campaign, in addition to the community's efforts on both sides to wage that campaign.""
Parker said she had planned to place the issue on this November's ballot had the petition been valid. If a court ultimately decides the issue should go to voters, she said, any legal action would make that date impossible.
If a vote were to occur, Feldman said, it would have to be held by November 2015.
""Clearly, the majority of Houstonians were not interested in a repeal process,"" Parker said, ""and I believe that the majority of Houstonians, had this made it to the ballot, would have upheld our decision.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,787,84.03,47.59,25.46,38.64,21.86,25.41,82.59,62.64,51.21,10.29,5.08,0.89,1.27,0,1.4,1.02,5.21,16.01,9.78,2.03,13.98,8.01,3.56,3.94,1.4,13.6,5.72,3.05,7.5,1.65,1.65,4.45,11.31,0.64,10.29,1.91,0.89,0.89,1.27,2.16,3.56,0,2.54,1.91,0.64,0.64,0.51,0.13,0,0,0,0,12.33,5.08,0.51,0,0.89,0.13,2.67,5.84,0,0,1.02,0.38,2.67,2.54,0.13,0,3.05,0,0.38,2.03,0.25,0.51,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,1.02,0,0.76,0.64,0.51,0,0.13,0.51,0.13,2.03,8.01,0.38,1.4,6.23,0.13,0,0.25,2.8,7.37,2.29,1.65,0.13,0,0.13,0,0,18.55,4.57,7.62,0,0,2.29,4.07,0,0.64,0,0,0,0.13,3.45,3.93,3.46,3.79,2.94,-3.09,-1.33,-0.03,-0.86,-1.18,1.02,0.13,0.13,0.25,1.02,0.25,0.38,0,1.27,0,0.51,0,1.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,1.3,15.4,127.06,0.89,228.72,0.51,88.95,0.64,292.25,2.8,127.06,-0.76,381.19,1.52,317.66,0,76.24,-0.13,38.12,0.13,12.71,0,25.41,127.06,63.53,50.83,12.71,88.95,0.51,127.06,25.41,12.71,25.41,0,0,0,127.06,0,50.83,50.83,25.41,12.71,1.14,1,0.25,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.25,0.38,0.13,0,1
7/25/14,4,Local News,Lubbock man says he was fired for being gay; law says it's OK - LGBT community has no legal protection against workplace discrimination in Lubbock ,"
Casey Stegall‚Äôs direct supervisor knew he was gay.
But, after he introduced his fianc√© to the kids he worked with at the Children‚Äôs Home of Lubbock, he was fired.
‚ÄúI got fired just for me being who I am,‚Äù he said.
A year after being hired and spending week after week caring for the children living at the home, he was dismissed for circumstances revolving around what Lynn Harms, president of the organization, called Stegall‚Äôs lifestyle choices.
‚ÄúAs a faith-based, church-related outreach providing welfare services, if you will, to children and families, there is a set of biblical values that we adhere to and live by,‚Äù Harms said. ‚ÄúWhen you are implementing life training and so forth ‚Äî particularly with children ‚Äî to put a confused message out there is counterproductive.‚Äù
In Stegall‚Äôs eyes, it was discrimination, but in the eyes of the law, it's legal.
Only 18 states and the District of Columbia have rules barring workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation ‚Äî Texas isn‚Äôt one of them.
Six cities and one county in Texas offer gays and lesbians protection against this type of discrimination ‚Äî Lubbock isn‚Äôt one of them.
Even with such a law, most have an exemption for churches and religious organizations.
While no city on the South Plains has an ordinance specifically addressing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, Mayor Glen Robertson said he's open to the idea.
‚ÄúIf anybody brought that issue forward, I‚Äôd be open-minded and look at it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those things that I do think should be done at the federal level, and I‚Äôm surprised that there isn‚Äôt a federal or a state law regarding that, especially as tight as our (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) stuff has gotten.‚Äù
Two sides of the same story
Stegall knew what he wanted to do with his life at an age when the biggest decision most people make is what to wear the next day.
Spending time with a child with a terminal illness and a cheerful outlook, Stegall knew working with kids was his calling.
As a human development and family studies major at Texas Tech, Stegall landed a job caring for children who‚Äôd never experienced a positive family atmosphere.
‚ÄúI got to be a part of their lives and I got to see that change in them from when we first got them, and I got to see them leave a whole new person,‚Äù he said, thinking of the children he worked with who have since been adopted.
Then, during a planned day trip out of the Children‚Äôs Home in early July, Stegall introduced the group of teenage boys to his fianc√©. Days later, Harms asked the caregiver to meet with him on Stegall‚Äôs day off. That‚Äôs when Stegall learned he no longer had a job.
‚ÄúHe told me that because of my lifestyle choices, he didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with me being on his team anymore,‚Äù he said.
Stegall said he had a spotless employment record with the organization and was often praised by his supervisors for the work he did with the kids.
Still, he was fired without an opportunity to defend himself against accusations of public displays of affection with another man, he said. Other employees who have been accused of what Stegall described as more heinous conduct were placed on paid leave until an investigation into the claims was completed.
Stegall was not given that opportunity, he said.
Stegall was aware of the organization‚Äôs Christ-centered mission when he applied for the job, but he never expected his relationship status to send him to the unemployment office.
‚ÄúMy fianc√© and I are both Christians and we both attend church,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI read the same Bible you read, I believe in the same God you believe in.‚Äù
Stegall has tried to find lawyers to represent him in suing his former employer, but had no luck.
‚ÄúI want my case out there ‚Äî even if I lose,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want my case out there so that people know that this is happening to people like me.‚Äù
Harms declined to talk specifically about Stegall‚Äôs employment, but said in a broad sense modeling a lifestyle not in line with the organization‚Äôs interpretation of the Bible is not acceptable, and new employees are briefed on the Children‚Äôs Home‚Äôs values during orientation.
‚ÄúIf you want to try to force our culture to meet your expectations, that‚Äôs not going to go well,‚Äù Harms said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel like the culture here has to meet an individual‚Äôs desire for the world to be different.‚Äù
Homosexuality isn‚Äôt the only lifestyle choice that falls into that category, Harms said. A person who is sexually promiscuous could also be dismissed on the same grounds.
‚ÄúPresenting a lifestyle that is damaging to kids could be a whole lot of things,‚Äù he said, citing aggression and ungodliness as examples.
Being gay is not always a fireable offense at the Children‚Äôs Home, however. Harms said there are employees who ‚Äúfly under the radar.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe core of it is how they conduct their business here,‚Äù he said.
Sexual preference doesn‚Äôt usually come up during an interview, but Harms said other homosexual employees have been fired for similar reasons.
Challenging the stereotype
Many of the kids who end up in the Children‚Äôs Home often come with a history of sexual abuse. From a therapeutic standpoint, Harms said homosexuals working with kids in that situation can be problematic.
‚ÄúIt gets garbled in terms of sexual identity, sexual preferences, fears, concerns, retraumatization,‚Äù he said.
Local psychologist Brian Carr, however, said being around a gay man is no more traumatizing to a sexual abuse victim than being around a straight man. ‚ÄúThere is no effect ‚Äî that‚Äôs ludicrous,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHe is combining the idea that people who are gay also have to have some sort of history of either being sexually molested or being sexual molesters, and that is not true.‚Äù
There is a stigma ‚Äî an antiquated one, Carr said ‚Äî about gay men working with children.
‚ÄúThat is prejudicial and completely inaccurate.‚Äù
A look at the law
It would be illegal for the organization to fire someone for being a man, for being a Christian or because he is Caucasian. Firing someone for being gay, however, doesn‚Äôt break any laws at the local, state or federal level.
‚ÄúI think that a lot of people think that because we all deserve a fair shake at work that it must be illegal to discriminate against somebody because he is gay. That‚Äôs not true,‚Äù said Rebecca Robertson, legal and policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.
And, even though there is protection in some areas of the country, many of those laws have religious exemptions, she said.
‚ÄúSo, no matter where somebody works, there is always a risk that they could get fired for being gay or lesbian and the employer could just say it point blank. There would not be any legal recourse,‚Äù Rebecca Robertson said.
Houston is the most recent Texas city to pass a municipal ordinance addressing the issue, after Mayor Annise Parker ‚Äî the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city ‚Äî led the charge.
The approval was greeted with thunderous applause from the audience, largely full of supporters, and chants of ‚ÄúHERO,‚Äù for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, according to the Houston Chronicle.
However, the ordinance passed in May is being challenged in court, Rebecca Robertson said. Obama's executive order
At the national level, an executive order issued by President Barack Obama Monday addresses the issue, but only impacts employees of companies with federal contracting work.
‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs federal contracts should not subsidize discrimination against the American people,‚Äù Obama said at a signing ceremony from the White House East Room. He said it‚Äôs unacceptable that being gay is still a firing offense in most places in the United States, according to a report by the Associated Press.
The president also noted that more states allow same-sex marriage than prohibit gay discrimination in hiring.
Until last month, Obama long resisted pressure to pursue an executive anti-discrimination order covering federal contractors in the hope that Congress would take more sweeping action banning anti-gay workplace discrimination across America, according to the AP.
A bill to accomplish that goal ‚Äî the Employment Non-Discrimination Act ‚Äî passed the Senate last year with some Republican support, but has not been taken up by the GOP-controlled House. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here to do what we can to make it right,‚Äù Obama said in the AP report.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1411,71.49,58.62,23.3,16.21,21.38,22.75,87.81,67.82,52.73,11.2,7.09,1.7,0.57,0.43,3.19,0.64,4.11,14.95,8.58,0.57,14.25,8.65,4.46,5.74,1.84,17.43,6.59,3.54,6.8,1.42,1.42,3.97,12.19,0.85,11.2,2.13,1.2,1.7,1.98,0.5,4.32,0,4.04,1.77,2.13,0.92,0.35,0.28,0.07,0.07,0,0,16.09,5.6,0.43,0.14,0.92,0.78,3.05,9.99,0.35,0.21,0.28,3.76,1.98,1.49,0.43,0.07,6.09,0,0.71,4.25,0.35,0.85,2.48,0.28,0.07,0,0.14,0,1.84,0,0,0.28,0.43,0.71,0.21,0.14,0,0.28,0.35,0.43,4.89,8.43,0.28,1.13,6.31,0.71,0.07,0.28,3.4,5.46,4.46,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,17.65,4.68,6.09,0,0,2.55,4.32,0,0.57,0,0.5,0,0.28,3.61,3.7,3,3.11,2.99,-3.21,-1.37,-0.9,-1.59,-2.19,0.43,1.06,0.28,0.92,0.78,0.57,0.78,0,0.64,0.14,0.85,0.64,0.92,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.41,1.1,19.24,148.83,1.13,311.84,-0.64,177.18,1.49,191.35,1.77,113.39,-0.92,248.05,-0.07,439.4,0,92.13,-0.21,99.22,0.85,49.61,0,184.27,99.22,141.74,49.61,21.26,92.13,0.07,219.7,63.78,21.26,42.52,14.17,0.14,0,63.78,42.52,233.88,127.57,49.61,21.26,1.84,1,0.47,0.2,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0.47,0.68,0,0,1
10/31/14,6,Faith and Values,"Commentary: Go online, read my sermons ","
The national conversation has been dominated by the news out of Houston that Mayor Annise Parker‚Äôs legal team has subpoenaed the sermon manuscripts of area pastors. Her office has pushed a controversial piece of legislation called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. As I write this article, the ordinance has passed into law and its proponents claim it is designed to protect the rights of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Houstonians.
Conservative pastors in that area took issue with some of the provisions and apparently Parker‚Äôs legal team believe they have the right to factor these sermons into their legal defense of the ensuing lawsuits. Many have written about the obvious threat this is to the First Amendment and to the separation of church and state. These are worthy causes to take up. We should never stand for our government interfering with free people believing in their cause and speaking their minds.
But the whole time this debate made the rounds on Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and every other news outlet, another thought occurred to me: Having given my adult life to the study and act of Christian preaching, I want you to know why I happily invite any person to read, view, download or podcast my sermons, including Mayor Parker‚Äôs team.
My reasons are rooted in the distinctive identity of true Christian preaching:
&diams; First, Christian preaching is good news. No other world religion places such a high priority on publicly declaring truth the way Christ followers do. Christians believe God has spoken and His message of redemption from sin as a means of restored relationship with God in all of its various facets should be told over and over.
&diams; Second, Christian preaching is Bible preaching. Admittedly, there are many examples of modern day preaching where the Bible is not the central source for the content of the sermon. This is unfortunate and unfaithful.
A true Christian preacher should not enter his pulpit to criticize those who hold different values. Rather, he should use the Bible to articulate God‚Äôs will about a particular matter, then help his people apply this truth in real and redemptive ways.
For example, in Houston there was much debate over a provision in the ordinance which allowed people to enter bathrooms based on their chosen gender identity rather than their actual sex. Bashing transgender people is not Christian preaching.
However, using the scriptures to show that God makes no separation between gender and anatomy when he creates people is not just loving and helpful, but it can also be freeing to those trapped in gender confusion.
&diams; Third, Christian preaching should never be seen as a threat to those who do not follow Christ or believe God‚Äôs word because Christ nor His word ever promote violence or other forms of sinful mistreatment.
I am well aware that in the so called ‚Äúname‚Äù of Christ there have been false teachers and cults who propagate violence. But this is not true Christian preaching. Christians have to understand that for their preachers to be biblical they will proclaim truth that is growing more and more controversial.
This is not because God is becoming more conservative or orthodox, for He does not change. Rather, it is because our culture is moving further and further away from the affirmation and acceptance of distinctively Christian values.
I believe that Jesus is the only way to have a right relationship with God and inherit eternal life. I believe that sex is designed to be experienced and enjoyed between one man and one woman inside of marriage. I believe that life begins at conception and ought to be protected. I believe that husbands and fathers should be the leader of their homes. I believe that every word of the Bible is inspired by God and without error. And I believe that everything I‚Äôve just expressed is now considered to be controversial. But not one time have I ever preached any of these truths and then instructed my flock to go out and hurt, mistreat or discriminate against others. Why? Because I also believe and preach that our greatest weapon of effectiveness in a world full of hurt is the rich, redemptive love of Christ flowing through His followers.
So if Parker‚Äôs lawyers call and want my sermons, I would gladly point them to the public website of our church where they can be viewed in their full and unedited form. Then I would hang up the phone and pray that she watches them with an open heart toward a God who loves her and gave His son that she might have eternal life.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,771,52.63,36.34,36.46,18.7,21.42,23.61,88.98,64.98,53.83,12.19,7.39,2.72,0.65,0.13,1.69,1.69,4.8,16.08,5.58,0.65,13.1,8.56,4.02,7.78,1.82,15.43,5.45,3.24,5.32,2.08,0.39,2.85,15.18,1.56,13.62,2.46,2.2,1.69,1.69,0.78,4.93,0,4.54,2.2,2.33,1.3,0.91,0.39,0,0,0,0,16.47,8.3,0.91,0,1.17,0.78,4.67,8.04,0.52,0,0.78,1.69,2.72,1.04,1.43,0.26,8.82,0.13,0.13,0.91,0.26,7.39,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0.26,0.26,0.52,0,0.26,0,0,0.78,0.39,5.06,8.43,0.26,0.91,6.61,0.65,0,0.26,1.95,2.33,4.93,0.78,0,0,0,0,0,9.99,4.54,3.11,0.13,0,0.91,1.3,0,0.52,0,0,0.26,0.52,2.85,2.94,2.65,2.66,2.75,-2.09,-1.23,-0.28,-0.75,-1.02,0.26,0.13,0.65,1.04,0.65,0.13,0.39,0.13,0.65,0,4.93,0.26,0.52,0,0.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,3.53,1.97,22.39,129.7,1.04,453.96,-0.13,181.58,1.43,181.58,1.17,129.7,-1.04,376.13,1.82,246.43,0,168.61,0.39,428.02,4.28,194.55,0,51.88,25.94,90.79,38.91,12.97,142.67,0,168.61,116.73,0,25.94,25.94,0.26,0,64.85,12.97,155.64,90.79,25.94,12.97,1.3,1,0,0.39,0,0,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.26,0,1
10/31/14,6,Revealations,Revelations: Houston mayor went too far ,"If there's one thing I've learned traveling around the world, it's how unique and important it is to have uncompromised First Amendment rights.
In many countries, it's indecent to speak openly about faith, women's rights, politics and political leaders, homosexuality or any number of gauche topics about the ways of the world.
But we forget that in many countries outside the United States, speaking openly about these topics is not only controversial - it's illegal.
At its worst, controversial speech and public practice of a minority faith may incur gross cultural shaming, violent physical harm or death.
You wouldn't believe some of the stories I've heard while traveling or while talking to American emigrants who've risked their lives to experience the freedoms we are afforded in the states.
They would give anything to be here and taste real freedom, which is founded on (for starters) our First Amendment rights.
So, I - like many nationwide - was shocked to read about all the hoopla between Houston Mayor Annise Parker - the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city - and Greater Houston's Christian religious community in recent days, specifically relating to five area pastors who oppose the mayor's Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which passed in May.
The ordinance, authored by Parker, was written to prevent employment, housing and public accommodation discrimination against the LGBT community.
But dissenters of the ordinance, or what's now being labeled as ""the bathroom bill,"" have decried the ordinance, particularly one area of the bill allowing transgender people to enter public restrooms of the gender they most closely identify with.
The controversy has delayed the bill's implementation and resulted in three Christians, including two pastors, suing the city in hopes of repealing the ordinance in November.
For her part, I can see how the ordinance was well-intentioned.
I'm certain Parker, now in a position of power, holds herself responsible for improving conditions for the Houstonian LGBT community.
I'm certain she may have experienced gay-related discrimination herself or known other homosexuals who have experienced discrimination.
But where the wires crossed for me on this issue wasn't about Houston Equal Rights Ordinance or the thought of transgender people entering a women's bathroom, although I'm personally never going to feel comfortable with a man in a woman's public restroom.
I'm an advocate for gay rights and have publicly stated I support nonreligious, civil gay marriage unions, and I enjoy many wonderful friendships with openly gay men and women.
But when I read that Parker's legal team instructed the five pastors - who are not a party to the lawsuit - to turn over documents, sermons, speeches and other communication ""related to the ordinance, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by or approved by you or in your possession"" to the city's attorneys, my jaw dropped open.
How is that good government? How is that legal? I wondered.
City attorneys issued subpoenas to the pastors not because they're part of the lawsuit but because of they're involved in the movement to repeal the ordinance.
It baffled me the pastors could be subpoenaed as nonlitigants. Their names on not involved in the lawsuit. They're just regular folks exercising their First Amendment rights.
And they should be allowed to do so without big bully government trying to shut them down.
While I'd hope the pastors, or anyone speaking openly in the public square about controversial issues, would express their opinions with respect and dignity for contrasting parties - we all have the right to say whatever they want, about anything we want.
Our freedom of speech isn't restricted to speaking on subjects everyone agrees with.
The pastors have a constitutional right to organize and speak their minds without government attempting to silence or shut them down.
So for me, this doesn't even come close to a fight about gay issues, the Christian right or left, liberals and democrats or transgender people in my bathroom stall.
The mayor started a fight - that in my opinion - violates the pastors' First Amendment rights. And well-intentioned or not, that's just not going to fly with me.

10/30/14,6,Politics,Houston Mayor Annise Parker withdraws pastor subpoenas after national uproar ,"
Houston Mayor Annise Parker announced Wednesday that she will withdraw subpoenas aimed at five local pastors after a national firestorm during which she was accused of anti-religious intimidation and abuse of power.
Ms. Parker said at a press conference that removing the subpoenas lets the city avoid a squabble over freedom of religion in the legal battle over its recently enacted gender-neutral bathroom bill.
""I didn't do this to satisfy them,"" Ms. Parker said of her critics in the Houston Chronicle. ""I did it because it was not serving Houston.""
Alliance Defending Freedom senior legal counsel Erik Stanley, who challenged the subpoenas on behalf of the pastors, said in a statement that Ms. Parker ""had no choice but to withdraw these subpoenas, which should never have been served in the first place.""
""The entire nation ‚Äî voices from every point of the spectrum left to right ‚Äî recognize the city's action as a gross abuse of power,"" Mr. Stanley said. ""We are gratified that the First Amendment rights of the pastors have triumphed over government overreach and intimidation. The First Amendment protects the right of pastors to be free from government intimidation and coercion of this sort.""
City officials originally issued subpoenas calling for pastors to turn over sermons related to the gender-neutral bathroom law, known as the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, but removed sermons from the subpoenas after a public outcry.
Ms. Parker, who is openly gay, said she made the decision to pull the subpoenas outright after meeting Tuesday with members of the local and national clergy.
""The goal of the subpoenas is to defend against a lawsuit, and not to provoke a public debate,"" Ms. Parker said in the Chronicle. ""I don't want to have a national debate about freedom of religion when my whole purpose is to defend a strong and wonderful and appropriate city ordinance against local attack, and by taking this step today we remove that discussion about freedom of religion.""
City officials were sued in August after ruling that a petition drive to place the ordinance on the ballot was insufficient, citing irregularities with many of the signatures. The lawsuit contends that the petitions, which contained more than three times the number required to qualify for the ballot, were sufficient.
The city responded by issuing subpoenas to five local pastors, none of whom was a party to the lawsuit, calling for all communications related to a host of topics, including the mayor, the ordinance, homosexuality and gender neutrality.
Mr. Stanley said the equal rights ordinance should be put before voters.
""The subpoena threat has been withdrawn, but the mayor and the city should now do the right thing and allow the people of the Houston to decide whether to repeal the ordinance,"" Mr. Stanley said.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is helping to host an event Sunday on behalf of the pastors called I Stand Sunday at Grace Community Church in Houston, which is also available for simulcast.
""While we are encouraged by this evidence that the Mayor is responding to pressure and withdrawing her unconstitutional subpoenas, this is about far more than subpoenas,"" said a statement by Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. ""As we have stated since the beginning of this intrusion into the private affairs of Houston churches; this is not about subpoenas, this is not about sermons, it is not even about biblical teaching on sexual immorality, it is about political intimidation and the bullying by Mayor Parker that continues.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,579,92.85,45.17,25.59,22.38,27.57,27.81,83.59,58.89,49.4,8.29,3.28,0.86,0.86,0,0.86,0.17,5.01,16.75,10.71,0.69,16.58,6.74,2.25,5.53,1.73,11.05,5.01,2.94,8.98,2.07,1.04,6.22,9.15,0.86,7.94,1.38,1.73,0.69,0,0,3.8,0,5.35,2.76,2.59,0.52,0.35,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,13.64,7.6,0.52,1.55,1.04,0.35,2.94,6.39,0,0,1.73,0.86,2.94,2.94,0,0,3.97,0.17,0,1.38,0,2.42,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.17,0.52,0,0.17,0.52,0.17,2.94,5.87,0,1.04,4.84,0,0,0,4.15,4.84,3.11,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,14.51,5.01,4.84,0,0,0.52,4.15,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,3.54,3.61,3.31,3.75,2.92,-3.73,-2.28,-1.15,-1.89,-1.75,0.52,0.35,0.17,0.35,1.04,0,0.52,0,0.69,0,1.04,0.35,1.38,0,0.52,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,1.38,1.4,17.6,172.71,0,431.78,0.17,86.36,0.35,345.42,3.45,103.63,-1.04,241.8,1.73,241.8,0,189.98,0.35,103.63,1.04,17.27,0,69.08,207.25,51.81,17.27,0,17.27,0.17,103.63,69.08,0,34.54,17.27,0.17,0,103.63,17.27,34.54,17.27,17.27,0,0.52,1,0.34,1.2,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0,1
10/29/14,6,Opinion,Houston mayor flexes muscles ,"I‚Äôve been to Athens, Greece. It‚Äôs an interesting place. There are a lot of ancient buildings and lots of history. A lot of Christianity can be studied in Greece.
There was one thing that bugged me in Greece and that was adjusting to the bathroom situation. When our group was traveling and eating in different restaurants women would be doing their business in the men‚Äôs restroom. My wife went into her restroom and there was a man sitting on a toilet. In the men‚Äôs restroom women would come in and find a stall without regard to the men lined up at urinals. Or, a man would come in, flip his hair back and pull up his skirt. I don‚Äôt mean to sound discriminating but I thought that was weird.
I‚Äôm for equal rights but I am not for stupid. I don‚Äôt think any man who can‚Äôt determine which gender he is on a given day should be using the women‚Äôs restroom. This is the way it is in Greece. I don‚Äôt like it. Greece is one of the nastiest places I‚Äôve ever been.
A woman should never have to be in the bathroom where one or a dozen men are doing their business. Or adult men should not be intermingling in shower rooms with women and girls. The scenarios can only grow. I don‚Äôt want to be in a bathroom with one or a dozen women. Let the men have their own public restrooms and let the women have theirs. Many businesses of course have one restroom and people of the opposite sex take turns and lock the doors when utilizing the facility.
The mayor of Houston, Texas wants her city to go Greek. This is not a joke. Mayor Annise Parker, a lesbian who has been open about her sexuality, helped push this law through in May. The ordinance bans discrimination against LGBT people in housing, in employment and in public spaces. The new law is called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance or HERO. A controversial part of the law would allow transgender people to file a complaint if they are prevented from using the bathroom of their choice. The law has yet to be implemented. Thousands of signatures have been gathered against the new law. City pastors, priests and leaders of most all faith groups have cried out against it. Five pastors have even had their sermons/speeches subpoenaed. They‚Äôve been suspected of making speeches against the new law or saying things that might be anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Mayor Parker is paranoid that these pastors may be speaking negatively about HERO or even her. She believes she can punish them if her attorneys can find statements in their speeches that are unflattering to her or the new law.
Is this woman crazy? Do I even need to ask?
Preachers and most all clergy have been voicing their opinions from the pulpits for a long time. Millions of people have been persuaded on how to conduct their lives ever since men and women started talking publicly. I will admit that not all ministerial sermons have led people in the right way. However, People have the right in this country to express their opinions either pro or con about anything. We must protect free speech 110 percent. LGBT people, evangelicals and all the Houston pastors have a say. However, as for me, if any of the preachers in Houston are publicly saying they think men and women should not be using the same bathroom at the same time then I‚Äôm going to say ‚ÄúAmen!‚Äù

10/26/14,6,News,"Conservative Christians, Civil libertarians united ","The bizarre drama that is the Houston sermon subpoena case has the American Civil Liberties Union and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R- Texas, on the same side.
And that‚Äôs the easy part to understand.
The Bayou City‚Äôs openly lesbian mayor, Annise Parker, has backed off her administration‚Äôs request to order clergy leading the fight to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance to turn over any sermons mentioning her, HERO, homosexuality or gender identity. Revised subpoenas keep after the pastors but reel in the dragnet for their homilies.
Parker has seemed to indicate she didn‚Äôt know the city was going after sermons. ‚ÄúLet me just say that (it was) one word in a very long legal document, which I know nothing about and would never have read, and I‚Äôm vilified coast to coast,‚Äù she said at a news conference.
However, just a couple days earlier, she tweeted, ‚ÄúIf the 5 pastors used pulpits for politics, their sermons are fair game.‚Äù
This apparent contradiction is only one of several pieces of evidence that Parker and her allies are using verbal misdirection to throw people off the trail of their attempt to chill the speech of clerics and others who dare disagree with HERO, which radically redefines discrimination to include the failure to allow the transgendered to access their desired gender‚Äôs bathroom.
The Houston scandal began with the City Council‚Äôs 11-6 passage of HERO, which, in turn, launched No Unequal Rights, a Christian-based coalition dedicated to repealing the ordinance. The group submitted nearly three times the number of petition signatures required to get the HERO repeal on the November ballot, and the city secretary initially certified that enough John Hancocks came in to put the question before voters.
However, City Attorney David Feldman said his subsequent look into the credentials of signature gatherers and how they filled out petition pages uncovered irregularities keeping the referendum out of the election. HERO opponents then filed suit to force the city government to stand by its initial certification. The action goes to court Jan. 19.
In reaction to the lawsuit, Parker‚Äôs lawyers subpoenaed the sermons and other public pronouncements of five pastors who spearheaded the petition drive, even though not one of the five is a plaintiff in the action over the referendum‚Äôs ballot status. The legal eagles said they want to establish what directions clergy gave on how to fill out petitions.
Naming religious discourses among the transcripts raised the hackles of the Texas chapter of the ACLU. ‚ÄúThe government should never engage in fishing expeditions into the inner workings of a church, and any request for information must be carefully tailored to seek only what is relevant to the dispute,‚Äù read its statement, which, ironically, also voiced support for HERO.
But there‚Äôs a flaw in the logic behind even the revised subpoenas. The guidelines issued by the pastors are immaterial; all that counts is whether the petition drive gathered the requisite number of valid signatures in the time allotted. Giving people directions doesn‚Äôt mean they follow them, as any church shepherd can tell you.
Parker‚Äôs politically correct camouflage can‚Äôt hide that she and her fellow social reformers want to silence their critics. They like to talk about inclusion and diversity, but just let an opponent start speaking, and the rhetoric of tolerance turns into angry accusations of hate speech.
America is rapidly shedding its religious heritage. Church attendance is falling, symbols of faith are disappearing from public life, and offering plates are near empty. This forsaking of God concerns me greatly, but I defend the right of people to choose to follow the Lord or not.
However, I‚Äôm not going to stand idly by while secular humanists try to deprive our nation of its First Amendment guarantees, including freedom of speech and religion and the right to petition government for a redress of grievances. The Supreme Court of Canada, our close ally and northern neighbor, has upheld hate-speech judgments against Christian activists speaking out against alternative lifestyles. Will the USA eventually go the same way?
If so, I echo what Saskatchewan‚Äôs Bill Whatcott said in reaction to the guilty verdict entered against him in his country‚Äôs highest court as he called into question the morality of homosexuality: ‚ÄúI have to follow Christ first. What I have said is true. There‚Äôs not a sentence that I retract, so likely future fliers will be more of the same.‚Äù
I will not go quietly ‚Äî nor, I pray, will the Revs. David Welch, Steve Riggle, Khan Huynh, Magda Hermida and Hernan Castano, the five Houston pastors targeted for harassment in the legal arena. This is the least we can do for God, whose words brought the universe into existence.

10/26/14,6,Opinion,Protecting the church from the state ,"Much has been made about the importance of keeping church and state separate - such as the dozens of lawsuits over the years from civil libertarians to keep Nativity scenes or the Ten Commandments as far from government property as possible.
Almost invariably, the focus in such controversy has been on how to keep the church out of the state, not the other way around. Until now.
It seems now the focus needs to be keeping the state - or more specifically, state and local governments - out of the churches. Consider these recent cases in point:
* In Houston, five Christian pastors were served with subpoenas by city prosecutors to turn over emails and transcripts of sermons addressing homosexuality.
The city earlier this year passed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, providing broad anti-discrimination protections to gay and transgendered residents. Both a lawsuit and a petition gathering signatures to repeal the law ensued, and the pastors - who weren't involved in the lawsuit but did support the signature drive - were issued subpoenas, with Houston Mayor Annise Parker tweeting the emails and sermon transcripts were ""fair game.""
* In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the owners of the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel were told their refusal to perform same-sex weddings violated the city's non-discrimination ordinance.
Warren Wilson, the city attorney, told an Idaho paper that the chapel ""would probably be considered a place of public accommodation"" and would therefore ""be subject to the ordinance."" This is in spite of the facts the chapel is registered as a ""religious corporation"" with the state and the stated mission of the owners - a husband and wife who are both ordained Pentecostal ministers - is to perform ""one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.""
* In California, elective abortion is now deemed part of ""basic health services"" that all insurance plans must cover - including the plans bought and provided by churches for their clergy and staff.
This all comes from regulatory changes, as the state's Department of Managed Health Care - prompted by the American Civil Liberties Union - has re-interpreted a four-decade-old state law on health services covered by insurance, now ordering abortion be covered by all plans. Ironically, California's DMHC - along with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - exempt churches from any contraceptive mandates, yet they've now issued a no-exception abortion mandate.
It's disappointing, but not surprising, that many of the same groups and individuals who protest even the slightest religious acknowledgement in public affairs are silent with regard toward these unwelcome intrusions of the state into church matters. Many are unsympathetic to religious stances to same-sex marriage, homosexuality and abortion, given that all three are becoming increasingly accepted in secular society. But even though all may have won several sizable legal battles both here and abroad, the practices remain contradictory to doctrines and principles of many of the world's most prominent religions.
In theory, those religious principles and practices are protected by the First Amendment. In reality, however, protections for religious conscience are proving to be woefully inadequate. The presumption seems to be that the free exercise of religion is only acceptable if it can justify itself in the eyes of the state. That's contrary to both the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution.
 We recognize the importance of keeping government from being dominated by religion, but the threat today is not creeping theocracy, but rather government insertion into private matters of religious faith. The First Amendment that was written to prevent the ""establishment of religion"" also forbids ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" If that doesn't protect matters of conscience unpopular with the day's latest trends and causes, then those words have no meaning.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,605,92.89,40.06,21.21,22.28,26.3,30.91,84.13,60,49.09,4.3,1.16,0,0.17,0,0,0.5,3.14,17.36,9.92,0.83,15.21,6.94,3.47,6.61,0.99,11.9,5.95,4.46,6.28,1.82,0.99,3.47,11.24,0.99,10.25,2.98,0.99,1.16,2.15,0.33,3.47,0,4.3,2.15,1.98,0.66,0,0.5,0.17,0.17,0.17,0,7.93,3.8,0.33,0.17,0.66,0.33,1.49,4.3,0.99,0,0.33,0.17,3.64,2.98,0.33,0.33,7.93,0.17,0.17,2.31,0.5,4.79,2.15,1.32,0,0,0,0,1.16,0,0,0.33,0,0.5,0.17,0,0,0.17,1.32,0,3.31,6.78,0.5,0.66,5.45,0.17,0.17,0,2.31,3.97,4.79,0.66,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,17.85,4.46,4.46,0,0,1.82,7.11,0,0.5,0,0,0.17,0,3.27,3.68,3.11,3.42,3.03,-1.75,-0.64,0.62,-0.21,-1.87,0.66,0.17,0.83,0.17,0.99,0,0.33,0,0.99,0,3.47,0,1.65,0.66,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,1.77,1.49,18.23,165.29,0.33,247.93,0.99,148.76,0.66,181.82,0.99,165.29,0.33,148.76,0.83,280.99,0,49.59,-0.17,347.11,3.14,0,0,66.12,280.99,132.23,66.12,0,82.64,0.33,181.82,0,16.53,16.53,33.06,0,0,82.64,33.06,165.29,16.53,33.06,0,0.99,1,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,1
10/25/14,6,Editorial / Columnists,Thomas: Houston clergy fight mayor's attempt to censor message ,"
Houston recently passed an ordinance through its city council that has sparked quite a bit of controversy amongst conservative evangelicals.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a broad-sweeping, left-leaning law trumpeted by the City of Houston and its openly gay mayor, Annise Parker, is supposed to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. All well and good, but according to the Independent Journal Review, the ordinance to ensure nondiscrimination, discriminates against those of faith who oppose it.
Five pastors, members of Houston‚Äôs conservative, evangelical base, oppose HERO and the pastors aren‚Äôt being too quiet about it. They‚Äôre circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed.
The City of Houston came up with a way to get them to stop. It issued subpoenas for pastors to turn over ‚ÄúAll speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,‚Äù so that it could, according to Time.com, ‚Äúdetermine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.‚Äù
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that last Friday, the City of Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ‚Äúsermon‚Äù from the subpoena, as well as ‚Äú...requests for pastors‚Äô teachings on sexuality and gender identity.‚Äù The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors‚Äô work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, and a Republican candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker‚Äôs office requesting she immediately drop the subpoena requests. As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ‚ÄúGovernment officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake.‚Äù
Amen to that, brother!
The subpoenas are censorship pure and simple and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state. How can the City of Houston‚Äôs actions be seen any other way by anyone right- or left-leaning, evangelical or secular?
Of course, after the outcry, Mayor Parker, broke out the politicians‚Äô primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù and would be amended. News flash, Mayor Parker. Still censorship. Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn‚Äôt stop the ship from sinking and deleting a few words from an ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù subpoena won‚Äôt make it anything other than what it is ‚Äî religious intimidation.
In their lawsuit, the pastors claim the mayor‚Äôs office unfairly and possibly illegally denied their petition to have HERO considered as a ballot referendum, alleging many of the 50,000 signatures on a petition ‚Äî triple the amount required ‚Äî were illegible or not verifiable.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ‚Äúwitnessing to the Gospel of Christ.‚Äù He says he did not receive a subpoena. The key word here is ‚Äúvoluntarily.‚Äù
For a government official to try to intimidate or censor speech from the pulpit, or any other form of communication, is clearly unconstitutional and this effort by Houston‚Äôs mayor should not survive a single court challenge.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,573,89.04,51.5,7.79,27.14,22.92,28.45,80.98,57.94,47.99,7.16,3.32,0.17,0.17,0.52,1.05,1.22,3.84,16.4,9.95,0.7,14.31,5.24,3.66,7.16,1.4,10.99,4.89,2.27,5.76,0.87,0.87,4.01,10.99,1.05,9.95,1.4,0.52,1.92,2.62,0.7,4.19,0,3.49,1.92,1.4,0.7,0.35,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,13.26,6.28,0.17,0.7,0.87,1.05,3.14,6.98,0.17,0,0.35,1.05,4.36,4.19,0,0.17,6.28,0,0,2.27,0,4.01,1.05,0,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.35,0.17,1.22,0,0,0,0,0.52,0.17,4.01,7.33,0.35,1.4,4.19,1.22,0.17,0.17,1.92,3.66,2.79,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,20.42,5.06,8.03,0.17,0.17,2.09,4.89,0,0.35,0,0,0.17,0,3.15,3.47,2.93,3.44,2.47,-2.88,-1.56,-0.69,-0.55,-1.63,0.52,0.17,0.17,0,0.87,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,1.57,0.17,0.87,0,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,2.75,1.47,18.3,157.07,0.35,314.14,0.35,157.07,0.87,244.33,1.4,104.71,0,174.52,-0.17,401.4,0,296.68,0.35,191.97,1.57,0,0,17.45,122.16,139.62,34.9,17.45,122.16,-0.17,87.26,69.81,0,17.45,34.9,0.17,0,139.62,52.36,139.62,87.26,34.9,0,0.17,1,0.17,1.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.33,0.17,0,1
10/25/14,6,NA,Illiberal tolerance ,"The following editorial was published recently in the Orange County Register:
Just this week, we took to these pages to voice our support for the growing tolerance that characterizes Americans' attitudes toward homosexuals, a dynamic that has undergone a radical change in recent years.
As staunch believers in individual liberty, we are heartened to see increasing support for the notion that people should be free to organize their lives as they choose, so long as they are not harming anyone else in the process.
That notion - that people of differing beliefs ought to leave each other well enough alone - should be where the conversation begins and ends. Alas, however, the temptation to persecute your opponents too often outweighs the impulse toward live-and-let-live.
That seems to be the case in Houston, which earlier this year passed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a piece of civil rights legislation that extended anti-discrimination protections to gay and transgendered Houstonians. While we have deep sympathy for the impulses that underpin such legislation, we have always regarded giving them the force of law as a threat to the right of free association. A society that respects minority rights should not force individuals to do business with anyone against their will.
The real issue in Houston, however, is not the law itself but the strong-arm tactics that have been used to defend it.
In the wake of HERO's passage, a signature drive was launched to get the law repealed, with the effort garnering support from segments of Houston's religious community. When supporters of the petition turned in signatures, most of them were disallowed, a matter that is now in court. Up to that point, this was a fairly conventional affair.
As part of the legal proceedings, however, the city has issued subpoenas for sermons and emails from a handful of pastors who were not involved with the lawsuit (but who did lend their support to the pledge drive). Moreover, Houston Mayor Annise Parker even tweeted that the records were ""fair game."" What's a little violation of the Constitution between friends, after all?
For people on either side of the Houston law, this development ought to be alarming. For one thing, the records have no relevance as to whether the gathered signatures were legitimate or not. For another - and more importantly - having the government scrutinize messages delivered from the pulpit is an unambiguous threat to First Amendment protections of religious liberty.

10/24/14,6,Editorials ,Houston pastors fight censorship challenge ,"
Houston recently passed an ordinance through its city council that has sparked quite a bit of controversy amongst conservative evangelicals. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, a broad-sweeping, left-leaning law trumpeted by the city of Houston and its openly gay mayor, Annise Parker, is supposed to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. All well and good, but according to the Independent Journal Review, the ordinance to ensure nondiscrimination, discriminates against those of faith who oppose it.
Five pastors, members of Houston's conservative, evangelical base, oppose HERO and the pastors aren't being too quiet about it. They're circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed. The city of Houston came up with a way to get them to stop. It issued subpoenas for pastors to turn over ""All speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,"" so that it could, according to Time.com, ""determine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.""
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that Oct. 17, the city of Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ""sermon"" from the subpoena, as well as ""... requests for pastors' teachings on sexuality and gender identity."" The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors' work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, and a Republican candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker's office requesting she immediately drop the subpoena requests. As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ""Government officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake."" Amen to that, brother!
The subpoenas are censorship pure and simple and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state. How can the city of Houston's actions be seen any other way by anyone right- or left-leaning, evangelical or secular?
Of course, after the outcry, Mayor Parker broke out the politicians' primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ""overly broad"" and would be amended. News flash, Mayor Parker. Still censorship. Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn't stop the ship from sinking and deleting a few words from an ""overly broad"" subpoena won't make it anything other than what it is ? religious intimidation.
In their lawsuit, the pastors claim the mayor's office unfairly and possibly illegally denied their petition to have HERO considered as a ballot referendum, alleging many of the 50,000 signatures on a petition ? triple the amount required ? were illegible or not verifiable.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ""happy"" to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ""witnessing to the Gospel of Christ."" He says he did not receive a subpoena. The key word here is ""voluntarily.""
For a government official to try to intimidate or censor speech from the pulpit, or any other form of communication, is clearly unconstitutional and this effort by Houston's mayor should not survive a single court challenge.

1 Call him America‚Äôs top Pop. When it came time for a pro coach again, the U.S. basketball team turned to the one considered the NBA‚Äôs best. Gregg Popovich, winner of five NBA championships, will have a chance to lead a team to Olympic gold. The San Antonio Spurs coach was hired Friday to replace Mike Krzyzewski as the U.S. basketball coach following the 2016 Olympics, a job he never knew he would get despite his undeniable place in coaching history. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine having this opportunity,‚Äù Popovich said at a press conference in San Antonio. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs still sinking in ... but I love it.‚Äù Popovich will take over starting with 2017 training camp and lead the Americans into the 2019 Basketball World Cup and 2020 Olympics if they qualify. ‚ÄúI had a short list,‚Äù USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo said. ‚ÄúIt started and ended with Pop.‚Äù

10/24/14,6,B,EDITORIAL - McNair stands up - Texans owner sets a brave example by rescinding support from anti-HERO group. ,"There are no instant replays in real life, but Texans owner Bob McNair got pretty close on Friday when he rescinded his $10,000 contribution to a group opposing Houston's embattled Equal Rights Ordinance. These are his words, in a written statement: ""To my great dismay, Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast and social media ‚Äã- including attributing certain statements of belief to me. Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me. Therefore I instructed the Campaign to return my contribution.""
McNair is no stranger to conservative political causes. He's donated more than $3 million to Republican groups since 2009. But Campaign for Houston, which opposes the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, crossed a line for the Texans owner, and on Friday he threw the flag. ""I do not believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind,"" McNair continued. ""I also believe we Houstonians should have an ordinance that unites our community and provides a bold statement of non-discrimination. . . .""
McNair apparently came to realize what this editorial page and other HERO proponents have been saying all along - that is, the virulent opposition to HERO is not based on facts about the ordinance but on the opponents' disdain for the growing social acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Houstonians. That opposition is so virulent, in fact, that Dr. Steven Hotze, Jared Woodfill and others leading the charge against the ordinance have resorted to a campaign of lies, distortion and fear- mongering. It's a campaign that deserves to be flushed down a toilet in one of those bathrooms prominently featured in their misleading ads.
The Texans owner no doubt recognizes dirty play when he sees it. Many of his fellow Houstonians, we suspect, are coming to the same awareness, regardless of whether they're completely comfortable with the ordinance. Legitimate opposition is one thing; foul play is another.
With his decision to rescind his donation, Bob McNair shows yet again that he and his Texans care about the well-being of this city.

10/23/14,6,B,LETTERS - HERO and freedom of speech ,"
Busy, busy
Regarding ""Truth about sermon subpoenas not as interesting as advertised"" (Page B1, Sunday), the article trivializes the serious infringement of the First Amendment. Columnist Lisa Falkenberg asserts that the language penned by the prestigious law firm Susman Godfrey LLP was ""a misstep, but one born of diligence and tone deafness, not malice."" Really? A misstep from this prestigious law firm?
And what of Mayor Annise Parker and City Attorney David Feldman, who say they did not see the wording on the subpoenas?
""In hindsight, he (Feldman) probably wished he'd reviewed it himself,"" Falkenberg wrote, ""but the guy has 1,000 cases on the docket..."" Not enough time for this issue?
Falkenberg also poses the question: ""If the Lord really approves of these pastors' messages regarding homosexuality, the equal rights ordinance and related issues, what's the problem with sharing those sermons with the world, or just a few lawyers?""
None, when it's a matter of choice.
Perhaps, all those busy people should review the writing in the First Amendment. It's brief. Millie Martin, Tomball
Hypocrisy
Columnist Lisa Falkenberg takes upon herself an improbable task: To absolve Mayor Annise Parker of any blame for the city's attempt to violate the First Amendment rights of several Houston pastors with a subpoena of their writings that included everything but the proverbial kitchen sink.
Falkenberg starts out by accepting without hesitation Parker's claim that she had ""no knowledge"" of the wording of the subpoenas, and that the blame rested with unnamed ""overzealous civil litigators."" This is implausible because the Parker camp was disputing petition signatures submitted challenging the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
As Falkenberg described Feldman's findings: ""Too many signatures were invalid because they didn't follow charter rules on requirements like notarization and verification.""
If that is true, why would the city try to confiscate everything these pastors ""prepared, delivered, revised or approved"" regarding the ordinance, homosexuality, gender identity or Parker?
We must also remark on the hypocrisy of it all: Parker routinely uses pastors, church settings and religion symbolism when it suits her political purposes.
If you're going to mix religion and politics, it's unseemly to use the powers of your office to harass others for doing the same thing. Pete Smith, Houston
Our freedoms Whatever you think about HERO, I hope we can all agree that it is not right for the city of Houston to ask pastors for the contents of their sermons. It is a violation of freedom of speech and freedom of religion - two freedoms that this country was established on.
My ancestors came to America so they could worship however they wanted. The government is not supposed to interfere with that.
I go to church, and I wouldn't want the government requiring a report of what people are saying - people wouldn't feel comfortable worshiping in that type of environment.
Jacob Long, age 12 Piney Point ...
Money management
Regarding ""Professional money management had its era, and that era is done"" (Page D3, Oct. 15), we believe that with appropriate research and monitoring of fund managers, investors' portfolios can outperform buy-and-hold index fund returns over extended periods.
Columnist Scott Burns' focus on fund performance and costs is important, but only to a point. Studies show that individual investors often fail to realize investment returns comparable to professional managers or even a ""buy-and-hold"" approach.
Investors often fear losses more than they appreciate gains and make decisions based on emotion rather than objective assessments. People tend to follow the crowd, be influenced by uninformed friends or relatives, give undue credence to recent headlines and fail to appreciate the normalcy of price volatility in financial markets.
Investing success is often more about discipline and controlling one's emotions than about selecting actively managed vs. passive funds.
Burns' readers may think they're being well-served by using low-cost index funds, but if they fail to control their emotions or get help from an adviser, they may find themselves saving pennies while losing dollars.
Doug Garrison, senior VP, Investec Advisory Group Lottery folly
Regarding ""Do the math - lottery should be abolished"" (Page B16, Sunday), the lottery appeals to greed and takes advantage of the very people who can least afford to lose the very money they spend on lottery tickets. I voted against the Texas lottery when it was put before voters in the 1990s, and I have shunned people who advocate this way to gain riches because of the number of people who must lose to produce just one winner. For that reason, lottery tickets must be the most stupid investment around. One can anticipate losing every time a ticket is purchased or multiple tickets depending on how greedy the person is.
David Greaves, Houstonchronicle.com Where's hardship?
Regarding ""Voter ID law under fire"" letter to the editor by Rachel Zoch, (Page B6, Wednesday), I do not understand the objections to the voter ID law. I am 72 years old and need a photo ID in many ways.
My children or my grandchildren would be more than willing to take me to one of the nearest Texas Department of Public Safety offices to get an election certificate or a personal ID. Why is this such a hardship?
I do appreciate the service of the older World War II vets, but they need a photo ID just like I do.

10/23/14,6,Editorials ,GUEST VIEW: Don‚Äôt go Greek in the bathroom ,"I‚Äôve been to Athens, Greece. It‚Äôs an interesting place. There are a lot of ancient buildings and lots of history. A lot of Christianity can be studied in Greece.
There was one thing that bugged me in Greece and that was adjusting to the bathroom situation. When our group was traveling and eating in different restaurants women would be doing their business in the men‚Äôs restroom. My wife went into her restroom and there was a man sitting on a toilet. In the men‚Äôs restroom women would come in and find a stall without regard to the men lined up at urinals. Or, a man would come in, flip his hair back and pull up his skirt. I don‚Äôt mean to sound discriminating but I thought that was weird.
I‚Äôm for equal rights but I am not for stupid. I don‚Äôt think any man who can‚Äôt determine which gender he is on a given day should be using the women‚Äôs restroom. This is the way it is in Greece. I don‚Äôt like it. Greece is one of the nastiest places I‚Äôve ever been.
A woman should never have to be in the bathroom where one or a dozen men are doing their business. Or adult men should not be intermingling in shower rooms with women and girls. The scenarios can only grow. I don‚Äôt want to be in a bathroom with one or a dozen women. Let the men have their own public restrooms and let the women have theirs. Many businesses of course have one restroom and people of the opposite sex take turns and lock the doors when utilizing the facility.
The Mayor of Houston Texas wants her city to go Greek. This is not a joke. Mayor Annise Parker, a lesbian who has been open about her sexuality, helped push this law through in May. The ordinance bans discrimination against LGBT people in housing, in employment and in public spaces. The new law is called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance or HERO. A controversial part of the law would allow transgender people to file a complaint if they are prevented from using the bathroom of their choice. The law has yet to be implemented. Thousands of signatures have been gathered against the new law. City pastors, priests and leaders of most all faith groups have cried out against it.
Five pastors have even had their sermons/speeches subpoenaed. They‚Äôve been suspected of making speeches against the new law or saying things that might be anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Mayor Parker is paranoid that these pastors may be speaking negatively about HERO or even her. She believes she can punish them if her attorneys can find statements in their speeches that are unflattering to her or the new law.
Is this woman crazy? Do I even need to ask?
Preachers and most all clergy have been voicing their opinions from the pulpits for a long time. Millions of people have been persuaded on how to conduct their lives ever since men and women started talking publically. I will admit that not all ministerial sermons have led people in the right way. However, People have the right in this country to express their opinions either pro or con about anything. We must protect free speech
110 percent. LGBT people, evangelicals and all the Houston pastors have a say. However, as for me, if any of the preachers in Houston are publically saying they think men and women should not be using the same bathroom at the same time then I‚Äôm going to say ‚ÄúAmen!‚Äù

10/23/14,6,NA,Houston‚Äôs - censorship - challenge ,"Houston recently passed an ordinance through its city council that has sparked quite a bit of controversy among conservative evangelicals. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a broad-sweeping, left-leaning law trumpeted by Houston and its openly gay mayor, Annise Parker, is supposed to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. All well and good, but according to the Independent Journal Review, the ordinance to ensure nondiscrimination discriminates against those of faith who oppose it.
Five pastors, members of Houston‚Äôs conservative, evangelical base, oppose HERO, and the pastors aren‚Äôt being too quiet about it. They‚Äôre circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed.
Houston then issued subpoenas for the pastors to turn over ‚ÄúAll speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,‚Äù so that it could, according to Time.com, ‚Äúdetermine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.‚Äù
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that last Friday, Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ‚Äúsermon‚Äù from the subpoena, as well as ‚Äú...requests for pastors‚Äô teachings on sexuality and gender identity.‚Äù The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors‚Äô work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker‚Äôs office requesting she immediately drop the subpoena requests. As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ‚ÄúGovernment officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake.‚Äù
The subpoenas are censorship, pure and simple, and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state.
After the outcry, Mayor Parker broke out the politician‚Äôs primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù and would be amended. News flash, Mayor Parker. It‚Äôs still censorship. Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn‚Äôt stop the ship from sinking and deleting a few words from an ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù subpoena won‚Äôt make it anything other than what it is ‚Äî religious intimidation.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ‚Äúwitnessing to the Gospel of Christ.‚Äù He says he did not receive a subpoena. The key word here is ‚Äúvoluntarily.‚Äù
For a government official to try to intimidate or censor speech from the pulpit, or any other form of communication, is clearly unconstitutional and this effort by Houston‚Äôs mayor should not survive a single court challenge.

10/23/14,6,National,Federal civil rights official calls Houston pastor subpoenas 'abuse of government power' ,"A member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in a letter Wednesday called Houston Mayor Annise Parker's subpoena of church pastors ""an abuse of government power"" and urged the mayor to withdraw the court documents.
Commissioner Peter Kirsanow said that the subpoenas, even after being amended to remove a request for church sermons, still appear to be ""a blatant attempt to punish these pastors for expressing their religiously based political views.""
""It punishes them by subjecting them to the stress of a subpoena (though they are not parties to the litigation), impairing their right to petition the government, forcing them to comply with a patently overbroad discovery request, and singling them out for opprobrium ‚Äî thus chilling future religiously informed speech,"" said Mr. Kirsanow, writing on behalf of himself and not the commission.
The subpoenas were issued after the city was sued in August for ruling that a pastor-led coalition had failed to gather enough signatures to place a referendum on an opposite-sex ""bathroom"" ordinance on the ballot. As a result, said Mr. Kirsanow, ""the validity of the signatures is the only legitimate issue.""
The commissioner's letter came as local and national religious leaders announced Wednesday an event in support of the five Houston pastors who were served with subpoenas, called I Stand Sunday.
The gathering, scheduled for Nov. 2 at Grace Community Church in Houston and available on webcast for other venues, is billed as a rally on behalf of the pastors and ""the freedom to live out our faith free of government intrusion or monitoring.""
Featured speakers include former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Alan and Phil Robertson of ""Duck Dynasty"" fame, Family Research Council president Tony Perkins, and several Houston pastors facing subpoenas, including Hernan Castano, Magda Hermida and Steve Riggle.
Mr. Huckabee, an ordained Southern Baptist minister who now hosts a popular show on Fox News, said at a teleconference that the Houston mayor's effort to subpoena the pastors has alerted the public to the potential threat to freedom of religion by government officials pushing ""gender-neutrality.""
""When pastors in Houston, Texas, are told, 'Give me your papers, correspondence with church members, sermon notes, church bulletins,' this is truly unsettling,"" Mr. Huckabee said. ""It could be what the mayor of Houston has done unwittingly is to do more to wake up people in the church pews than 100,000 pastors could have done by screaming at the top of their lungs that our culture is rapidly fading away from us.""
Mr. Perkins said Houston's effort to subpoena church sermons is ""not about speeches, it's not about sermons, it's not about teachings even on biblical morality as it pertains to homosexuality ‚Äî this is about intimidation.""
""It's about political intimidation, and it's about a mayor there using her bully pulpit to try to silence the pulpits of Houston,"" Mr. Perkins said. ""I'm proud to say that these pastors are not being intimidated, they're not shrinking back, and they're not going to go silent.""
City officials removed from the subpoenas the section requesting sermons after a political firestorm that quickly gained national attention. At first Ms. Parker called the sermons ""fair game,"" but several days later she agreed to amend the subpoenas by removing the reference to sermons.
But the subpoenas still order the pastors to produce emails, texts and other communications with church members and others that pertain to not only the signature-gathering effort but such topics as the mayor, homosexuality and gender identity. Attorneys for the pastors have challenged the subpoenas in court.
Houston City Attorney David Feldman disallowed about 35,000 of the 50,000 signatures submitted by a pastor-led coalition challenging the so-called ""bathroom bill,"" citing irregularities. The petitions, which were initially ruled sufficient by the city secretary, needed 17,269 valid signatures to qualify for the ballot.

10/22/14,6,NA,Houston pastors fight censorship challenge ,"Houston recently passed an ordinance through its city council that has sparked quite a bit of controversy amongst conservative evangelicals. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a broad-sweeping, left-leaning law trumpeted by the City of Houston and its openly gay mayor, Annise Parker, is supposed to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. All well and good, but according to the Independent Journal Review, the ordinance to ensure nondiscrimination, discriminates against those of faith who oppose it.
Five pastors, members of Houston's conservative, evangelical base, oppose HERO and the pastors aren't being too quiet about it. They're circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed. The City of Houston came up with a way to get them to stop. It issued subpoenas for pastors to turn over ""All speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by your or in your possession,"" so that it could, according to Time.com, ""determine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.""
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that last Friday, the City of Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ""sermon"" from the subpoena, as well as ""...requests for pastors' teachings on sexuality and gender identity."" The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors' work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, and a Republican candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker's office requesting she immediately drop the subpoena requests. As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ""Government officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake."" Amen to that, brother!
The subpoenas are censorship pure and simple and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state. How can the City of Houston's actions be seen any other way by anyone right- or left-leaning, evangelical or secular?
Of course, after the outcry, Mayor Parker, broke out the politicians' primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ""overly broad"" and would be amended. News flash, Mayor Parker. Still censorship. Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn't stop the ship from sinking and deleting a few words from an ""overly broad"" subpoena won't make it anything other than what it is - religious intimidation.
In their lawsuit, the pastors claim the mayor's office unfairly and possibly illegally denied their petition to have HERO considered as a ballot referendum, alleging many of the 50,000 signatures on a petition - triple the amount required - were illegible or not verifiable.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ""happy"" to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ""witnessing to the Gospel of Christ."" He says he did not receive a subpoena. The key word here is ""voluntarily.""
For a government official to try to intimidate or censor speech from the pulpit, or any other form of communication, is clearly unconstitutional and this effort by Houston's mayor should not survive a single court challenge.

Five pastors, members of Houston's conservative evangelical base, oppose HERO, and the pastors aren't being too quiet about it. They're circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed.
The city of Houston came up with a way to get them to stop. It issued subpoenas for pastors to turn over ""all speeches, presentations or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,"" so that it could, according to Time.com, ""determine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.""
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that last Friday, the city of Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ""sermon"" from the subpoena, as well as ""requests for pastors' teachings on sexuality and gender identity.""
The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors' work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general who also is running as a Republican Party candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker's office requesting that she immediately drop the subpoena requests.
As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ""Government officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake.""
Amen to that, brother!
The subpoenas are censorship, pure and simple, and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state.
How can the city of Houston's actions be seen any other way by anyone right- or left-leaning, evangelical or secular?
Of course, after the outcry, Mayor Parker broke out the politicians' primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ""overly broad"" and would be amended.
News flash, Mayor Parker. It's still censorship.
Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn't stop the ship from sinking, and deleting a few words from an ""overly broad"" subpoena won't make it anything other than what it is ‚Äî religious intimidation.  In their lawsuit, the pastors claim that the mayor's office unfairly and possibly illegally denied their petition to have HERO considered as a ballot referendum, alleging many of the 50,000 signatures on a petition ‚Äî triple the amount required ‚Äî were illegible or not verifiable.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ""happy"" to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ""witnessing to the Gospel of Christ."" Young says he did not receive a subpoena.
The key word here is ""voluntarily.""
For a government official to try to intimidate or censor speech from the pulpit, or any other form of communication, is clearly unconstitutional.
This effort by Houston's mayor should not survive a single court challenge.

10/22/14,6,Opinion,Houston pastors fight censorship ,"Houston recently passed an ordinance through its city council that has sparked quite a bit of controversy among conservative evangelicals. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, a broad-sweeping, left-leaning law trumpeted by the City of Houston and its openly gay mayor, Annise Parker, is supposed to protect gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination. All well and good, but according to the Independent Journal Review, the ordinance to ensure nondiscrimination discriminates against those of faith who oppose it.
Five pastors, members of Houston‚Äôs conservative, evangelical base, oppose HERO, and the pastors aren‚Äôt being too quiet about it. They‚Äôre circulating petitions and gathering signatures in an attempt to get the law repealed. The City of Houston came up with a way to get them to stop. It issued subpoenas for pastors to turn over ‚ÄúAll speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,‚Äù so that it could, according to Time.com, ‚Äúdetermine how the preachers instructed their congregants in their push to get the law repealed.‚Äù
No one was surprised when the pastors filed suit.
The blowback to the subpoenas was so intense that last Friday, the City of Houston backpedaled and dropped the word ‚Äúsermon‚Äù from the subpoena, as well as ‚Äú... requests for pastors‚Äô teachings on sexuality and gender identity.‚Äù The city still wants to see all the speeches, presentations, documents, text messages and emails that relate to the pastors‚Äô work to get HERO repealed, though.
Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general, and a Republican candidate for governor, sent a letter to Mayor Parker‚Äôs office requesting she immediately drop the subpoena requests. As reported on Christianitytoday.com, he wrote: ‚ÄúGovernment officials must exercise the utmost care when our work touches on religious matters. Your aggressive and invasive subpoenas show no regard for the very serious First Amendment considerations at stake.‚Äù Amen to that, brother!
The subpoenas are censorship pure and simple, and they blur the line of demarcation that is supposed to separate church from state. How can the City of Houston‚Äôs actions be seen any other way by anyone right- or left-leaning, evangelical or secular?
Of course, after the outcry, Mayor Parker, broke out the politicians‚Äô primer and issued a well-crafted statement that said the subpoenas were ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù and would be amended. News flash, Mayor Parker. Still censorship. Tossing a few deck chairs off the Titanic didn‚Äôt stop the ship from sinking and deleting a few words from an ‚Äúoverly broad‚Äù subpoena won‚Äôt make it anything other than what it is ‚Äî religious intimidation.
In their lawsuit, the pastors claim the mayor‚Äôs office unfairly and possibly illegally denied their petition to have HERO considered as a ballot referendum, alleging many of the 50,000 signatures on a petition ‚Äî triple the amount required ‚Äî were illegible or not verifiable.
Dr. Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church in Houston, jokingly tells me he is ‚Äúhappy‚Äù to send his sermons to the mayor and has done so voluntarily in the past as a form of what Baptists call ‚Äúwitnessing to the Gospel of Christ.‚Äù He says he did not receive a subpoena.

10/20/14,6,Life,"Amid sermon subpoena debate, 'church autonomy' issue rises ","One day after news that Houston city attorneys had subpoenaed sermons and emails from church leaders presumably opposed to a local human rights ordinance, the civil liberties questions remain.
Legal scholars question whether ""church autonomy,"" which allows religious groups wide latitude over internal operations, can properly apply in civil litigation discovery. Or, whether the subpoenas amount to harassment and a violation of constitutionally protected free speech.
Houston city attorney David Feldman, meanwhile, still wants to know what churches did to support a controversial referendum to overturn the ordinance that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation among businesses that serve the public in housing and in city employment and city contracting. The ordinance exempted religious institutions, according to The Christian Science Monitor.
When Feldman rejected thousands of petition signatures aimed at placing the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, on a citywide ballot this fall, opponents of the measure sued to overturn the measure. That lawsuit prompted the legal process, known as ""discovery,"" in which attorneys working pro bono for the city issued the subpoenas to five Houston pastors, even though the clerics were not among those suing over the denied referendum petitions.
""They are not party plaintiffs"" to the lawsuit, Feldman told Fox News columnist Todd Starnes, ""but they certainly appeared before council repeatedly regarding the ordinance and the petition. This petition was organized at the churches. That‚Äôs where the organizing drive took place. That‚Äôs where rallies were held. That‚Äôs where signing parties were held.""
After concerns over the nature of the subpoenas erupted, Houston Mayor Annise Parker tried to walk back the city's position outlined in the legal documents.
""There's no question the wording was overly broad, but I also think there was some deliberate misinterpretation on the other side,"" Parker said, according to KHOU-TV.
""The goal is to find out whether there were some specific instructions given on how the petitions were accurately filled out,"" Parker added. ""It's not about 'what did you preach upon last Sunday?' It should've been clarified. It will be clarified.""
Those failing to comply will with the subpoena will be held in contempt of court, the Monitor reported.
But the city's lawyers will face a high bar for proving the information in the sermons is essential to their case, Charles Rhodes, a South Texas College of Law professor, told the Houston Chronicle, accord to the Monitor's report. The pastors are not named parties in the lawsuit, and the (Constitution's First Amendment) ""Church Autonomy Doctrine"" offers fairly broad protections for internal church deliberations, he said.
Marci Hamilton, who holds a chair in public law at Yeshiva University's Benjamin N. Cardozo Law School in New York City, asserted ""church autonomy"" does not exist: ""The Supreme Court has never used the term or even implied a theory close to it,"" she wrote in an email.
""Churches and pastors are not above the law and this type of discovery is ordinary in federal litigation,"" Hamilton wrote in an email. ""As I understand these issues, one question is whether these pastors violated the federal tax laws that limit political advocacy if a nonprofit is claiming tax exemption.""
However, IRS regulations, as posted on its website, refer to churches not being allowed to endorse (or oppose) candidates: ""Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or ntervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office,"" the agency stated.
And, Douglas Laycock, a distinguished professor of law at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville, Virginia, said those opposed to the Houston subpoenas may not have to appeal to ""church autonomy"" to protect their sermons and internal correspondence.
""Free speech is really the main argument,"" Laycock said in a telephone interview. ""These subpoenas seem designed to intimidate and harass"" those opposed to the Houston ordinance. He said if the legal discovery process is being ""used to penalize these people ... that clearly seems a penalty"" on their free speech.
He added, ""I think government issuing subpoenas for sermons ought to ring alarm bells for free speech and free exercise."" Apparently, Texas state attorney general ‚Äî and 2014 GOP gubernatorial candidate ‚Äî Greg Abbott agrees with Laycock's position.
In a letter calling on Feldman to withdraw the subpoenas, Abbott wrote: ""Whether you intend it to be so or not, your action is a direct assault on the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment. The people of Houston and their religious leaders must be absolutely secure in the knowledge that their religious affairs are beyond the reach of the government.""

10/20/14,6,Opinion,Houston trying to bully churches ,"WASHINGTON ‚Äì Cardinal Francis George of Chicago said a couple of years ago that he expected to die in bed, but that his successor would die in prison, and that archbishop‚Äôs successor would be martyred in the public square.Was this Cardinal George‚Äôs indulging in hyperbole, or is the cardinal actually behind the times in chronicling the march of political correctness?
For example, the archdiocese of Washington and many other dioceses had to scrap their participation in adoption and foster child programs because their municipalities made same-sex marriage the law, with no exceptions for practicing Catholics.Cardinal George was originally commenting on the amazing diligence of President Obama, who had received an honorary degree from the University of Notre Dame, in demanding that all Catholic colleges and institutions provide insurance for all their employees to obtain birth control, sterilization and abortion-inducing drugs.These practices and same-sex marriage are not embraced by the Catholic Church, yet. (In the age of Pope Francis, stay tuned.)But the Houston city government is unveiling new frontiers in political correctness and intimidation for traditional Christians and their ministers who don‚Äôt go along.
Attorneys for Houston have subpoenaed several ministers to produce their sermons that oppose the new Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, according to the blog Houston Press and several other digital publications.The new law mirrors many codes around the nation that protect transgenders and gays against discrimination in public accommodations, employment, housing and other fields.
The evangelical ministers are part of a campaign to gin up a referendum to repeal HERO. As it goes, the conflict is fairly predictable in the conservative South.
What‚Äôs new here is the degree to which the city has gone to defend HERO. There‚Äôs nothing uncommon about citizens trying to repeal a law. The marshaling of clergy in their specific opposition from the pulpit in a political fight can, however, raise serious issues about the behavior of a church, which enjoys state and federal tax exemption.
This tax exemption is a trade-off for any church‚Äôs immunity from interference from the government concerning what the church says about religion. Freedom of worship is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
Until Obama‚Äôs contraception mandate, the state and the churches ordinarily gave each other a lot of space, breathing room.
But Houston‚Äôs lawyers went far beyond this breathing space. Not only did the City of Houston demand the preachers produce their sermons dealing with the repeal petitions.
The city also insisted the ministers reveal ‚Äúcommunications with anyone,‚Äù according to Houston Press, ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO ... prepared by, revised by, approved by or in your possession.‚Äù
The key phrases here are ‚Äúcommunications with anyone‚Äù and ‚Äúin your possession.‚Äù
These demands are not only a violation of constitutional guarantees of freedom of worship and of speech, they are right out of George Orwell‚Äôs ‚Äú1984‚Äù and Ray Bradbury‚Äôs ‚ÄúFahrenheit 451,‚Äù works of fiction where both rights were savagely suppressed.
Many have curbed their voices over the years in a wholesome spirit of tolerance and understanding. But tolerance doesn‚Äôt seem to be the toolbox of these self-righteous bullies of Houston, or for that matter among most Washington Democrats.
The City of Houston‚Äôs radical overreach will probably be modified. But this thrust becomes a benchmark in the slog of political correctness and will somehow, somewhere become commonplace.

10/19/14,6,B,Commentary - Truth about sermon subpoenas not as interesting as advertised ,"
Imagine my surprise when, upon returning to town after a few days off the grid, I find the Wicked Lesbian Mayor of Houston has declared war on the Good Christian Preachers of Texas, going so far as to threaten their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and religion.
According to the pastors, their legal counsel, and right-leaning ""news"" sites, Mayor Annise Parker took aim at Christian pastors who opposed her anti-discrimination ordinance by having their kitchen sinks subpoenaed last month, and their sermons to boot. The subpoena sought pastors' presentations in and out of the pulpit related to homosexuality, gender equity, and the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, among other things.
U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz quickly accused Parker of trying to ""silence the church."" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, accused Parker of assaulting religious liberty. Fox's Sean Hannity offered to bail out pastors from jail, if it came to that.
All the hand-wringing and laments of Christian victimhood seemed so fun, I almost thought of joining in. After all, I like Christ, I'm in the free speech business and nobody likes a government bully.
But then I did some homework.
The truth can be such a killjoy. The story turned out to be pure Republican pre-election fantasy.
Found lurking among the details was (surprise!) no devil. Only routine lawyering by overzealous civil litigators - stuff so unsexy it couldn't even qualify for a crawler headline on Fox News.
The impetus for the controversy appears to have nothing to do with Christ, or free speech or government bullying.
Even the contention that Parker was directly involved appears to be wrong. The mayor and city attorney David Feldman both say they didn't see the wording of the subpoenas before they went out. The language was penned by the prestigious law firm Susman Godfrey LLP, which Feldman says is representing the city in the high-profile case for no fee.
Feldman's staff reviewed it and saw no problem, he said. In hindsight, he probably wishes he'd reviewed it himself, but the guy has 1,000 cases on the docket and litigation is only about 40 percent of his job.
Regardless, Parker and Feldman both acknowledged the subpoenas, although perfectly legal, were overly, unnecessarily broad. Feldman said the word ""sermon"" shouldn't have been used. They've since narrowed the subpoenas.
Usually, when there's a disagreement in the lawsuit about what a party is asking for during the discovery phase, people call each other and work it out before they go to court. In this case, attorneys suing the city quickly filed a motion to quash the subpoena and certain media were alerted.
Politics suspected
While pre-election political ramifications apparently didn't occur to the aggressive litigators at Susman, they were clearly front and center on the minds of the pastors, and the group actually suing the city, which is led by recently ousted Harris County Republican Party Chairman Jared Woodfill.
Woodfill and gang sued after the city attorney rejected a petition aimed at repealing the mayor's anti-discrimination ordinance, which extended protections to gay, lesbian, transgender and bisexual residents. Religious organizations were exempt, but a few local pastors helped lead the charge in the petition drive.
The lawsuit stems from the fact that the city secretary initially found the group had enough signatures, but the city attorney later found that too many signatures were invalid because they didn't follow charter rules on requirements like notarization and verification. Plaintiffs want the city to honor the city secretary's initial count, regardless of any rules violations.
So, you may be asking, what does all this have to do with sermons of pastors who aren't even party to the lawsuit? Petition drive
The city says it has no interest in mining religious speech for the heck of it, says Feldman. All pastors subpoenaed - a grand total of five, not every pastor in Texas - were actively involved in the petition drive. A video obtained by the city shows one pastor, David Welch, instructing others on the importance of following charter rules in the petition process.
The video, says Feldman, shows some petition organizers were familiar with the rules that they allegedly failed to follow. Feldman says the city's lawyers wanted to find out if other pastors were giving similar instructions - in or out of the pulpit.
To find out, the Susman attorneys cast a wide net as attorneys often do. In this politically sensitive case, it was a misstep, but one that appears to be born of diligence and tone deafness, not malice.
""If you're going to use a church for a political process, then any communications that are made are just as subject to discovery as if you did it in a commercial building,"" Feldman told me. ""They chose to do it at churches. I didn't tell them to do that. And it's fine, except you can't engage in a political activity at a church and pursue litigation regarding that and then hide behind the separation of church and state for not producing anything.""
I asked Feldman why the city couldn't just build its case on the alleged rules violations. Why did it need to show the plaintiffs were aware of the rules?
""We've got plaintiffs who are saying the rules don't matter at all,"" he said. ""The more evidence that they're telling their people they must follow these rules, the more suspect their claim that the rules don't matter.""
The talking heads at Fox and others fanning the flames in this deal have cited a recent, supposedly sinister tweet by Parker stating that, if the five pastors used pulpits for politics, ""their sermons are fair game.""
Legally, it's clear what Parker meant. Fair game in litigation. Not fair game to attack for political reasons. Eleventh-hour move
This whole story is nothing more than an eleventh-hour attempt to rouse Republican fears and prejudices before an election by portraying Houston's lesbian, Democratic mayor as anti-Christian or un-American. Scared people vote.
It's a brilliant ploy and powerful edge that the tone-deaf lawyers appointed by the city delivered to Republicans with pretty red ribbon.
Only one thing I can't understand. Sermons are given in public, before God, the choir, the ushers, and anybody who happens to stumble in from the street and attend worship.
They're ostensibly given in the name of God, who you'd think would want to cast his own net as widely as possible.
If the Lord really approves of these pastors' messages regarding homosexuality, the equal rights ordinance, and related issues, what's the problem with sharing those sermons with the world, or even just a few lawyers?",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1098,81.5,36.4,27.62,19.15,18.93,25.59,82.97,61.57,50,9.11,4.46,0.91,0.09,0.46,0.73,1.73,4.64,15.76,9.56,0.64,13.93,7.01,3.37,6.65,2.09,14.12,5.19,3.01,6.56,1.09,0.91,4.64,12.3,1.18,11.02,2.19,1.09,1.28,2.73,0.36,4.1,0.09,3.73,1.73,1.82,0.82,0.18,0.46,0.18,0.18,0,0,12.48,5.56,0.18,0.18,1,0.64,2.91,5.92,0,0,0.36,0.73,3.46,3.19,0.27,0,6.38,0.73,0.27,2.19,0.36,3.01,1,0,0,0,0,0,0.64,0.09,0,0.46,0.36,0.36,0,0.09,0,0,0.36,0.18,3.19,8.74,0.46,1.28,5.74,0.91,0.18,0.09,2.64,5.37,3.55,0.64,0.09,0.09,0,0,0,17.85,5.1,6.28,0.27,0.09,3.01,3.1,0,0.27,0,0,0.18,0.09,2.9,3.36,2.77,3.21,2.43,-3.47,-1.88,-0.7,-1.32,-1.96,0.18,0.18,0.18,0.27,1.28,0,0.55,0,0.36,0,1.91,0.09,1.46,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.22,1.73,18.26,109.29,0.73,346.08,-0.36,209.47,1.64,255.01,1.37,109.29,-1.09,282.33,-0.27,255.01,0,218.58,0.27,182.15,1.82,0,0,27.32,163.93,145.72,0,0,127.5,0,81.97,36.43,36.43,45.54,54.64,0.55,0,109.29,9.11,54.64,54.64,36.43,0,0.91,1,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.09,0.09,0,1
10/18/14,6,B,Religion - Critics say revised equal rights subpoenas still no good ,"Mayor Annise Parker on Friday followed through on her pledge to narrow the scope of subpoenas sent to local pastors who led opposition to the city's equal rights ordinance earlier this year, but conservatives, who have rallied nationwide against what they insist is an infringement of religious freedom, said it was not enough.
Though the subpoenas' new wording removes any mention of ""sermons"" - a reference that elicited responses from numerous politicians, including Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who accused Parker of trying to ""silence the church"" - the mayor acknowledged the new subpoenas do not explicitly preclude sermons from being produced.
""We don't need to intrude on matters of faith to have equal rights in Houston, and it was never the intention of the city of Houston to intrude on any matters of faith or to get between a pastor and their parishioners,"" Parker said. ""We don't want their sermons; we want the instructions on the petition process. That's always what we wanted, and, again, they knew that's what we wanted because that's the subject of the lawsuit.""
Opponents took advantage of the broad original language, Parker said, to deliberately misinterpret the city's intent and spur what City Attorney David Feldman called a ""media circus.""
The subpoenas are part of the discovery process in a lawsuit filed by opponents of the nondiscrimination measure City Council passed in May. Known as HERO, for Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the law bans discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. The city has suspended enforcement of the ordinance until the lawsuit, which is set for trial in January, is resolved.
Opponents had mounted a petition drive to force a voter referendum to repeal the ordinance, but city officials ruled thousands of signatures ineligible and did not place the item on the ballot, triggering the suit.
None of the five pastors targeted by the subpoenas is a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Backstep on sermons
The subpoenas now seek ""all speeches or presentations related to HERO or the Petition"" that the pastors delivered, revised, approved or have on hand. Previously, the wording also had mentioned ""sermons"" as well as ""homosexuality, or gender identity,"" protected classes that were covered in the city ordinance but are not listed in state or federal laws.
Conservative leader Jared Woodfill, one of four plaintiffs in the suit, said the revision does not go far enough. The city needs to withdraw any subpoena related to pastors or religious institutions, he said, arguing that Houston can build its case from the documents already subpoenaed from the plaintiffs, such as information about the people who circulated the petitions.
""The mayor needs to get the city out of the business of subpoenaing churches. There's absolutely no reason for this city to be trampling on the First Amendment rights of these pastors,"" Woodfill said. ""It starts with these five, and then who's next? There were pastors all across the state talking about the HERO ordinance.""
Woodfill's thoughts were echoed by national conservative groups.
'Solves nothing'
Family Research Council president Tony Perkins called the revision a ""head fake"" that does not remove the city's infringement of eligious liberties, and Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Erik Stanley said the revision ""solves nothing.""
The ACLU of Texas said it supports the nondiscrimination ordinance but cheered the mayor's decision to narrow the subpoenas, saying, ""There was no need to include sermons in the subpoena in the first place.""
Though a speech from the pulpit about the HERO ordinance - something still covered by the new subpoenas - could be interpreted as a sermon, Feldman said the key is the content of the message. The city is not interested in religious speech, he said, but in any references to the petition process.
""If during the course of the sermon - and I doubt this very much - a pastor took 15 or 20 minutes to go into detail about how the petition process goes, then that's part of the discovery,"" Parker said. ""But that's not about preaching a sermon on anybody's religious beliefs, it's not conveying a religious message; that's part of the petition process, and all we're interested in is the petition process.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,707,92.31,32.12,31.2,38.68,25.25,29.56,81.19,59.55,49.22,7.07,2.69,0.14,0.85,0,0.42,0.57,4.38,17.82,11.88,1.13,14.57,6.22,2.97,5.52,2.4,12.45,3.82,3.11,5.09,1.27,0.57,3.39,14,1.41,12.59,2.55,1.41,1.56,2.4,0.14,4.95,0,2.4,1.84,0.57,0.28,0.14,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,12.45,6.22,0.14,0,0.57,0.85,4.24,5.23,0,0,0.14,0.28,3.11,3.11,0,0,6.22,0,0.14,2.83,0.28,3.25,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0.57,0.57,0.71,0.28,0.14,0,0.14,0.42,0.71,2.83,7.5,0.42,0.85,6.22,0.14,0.28,0,2.69,5.52,4.81,0.14,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,18.53,4.1,5.94,0.14,0,2.97,5.37,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,2.93,3.51,2.9,3.36,2.72,-2.78,-0.89,0.17,-0.27,-1.17,0.42,0.42,0,0,1.27,0.14,0.42,0,0.71,0,1.7,0,0.85,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.98,0.78,15.64,42.43,0.14,169.73,-0.28,127.3,1.27,212.16,1.41,56.58,-0.28,183.88,0.28,311.17,0,155.59,0,127.3,1.27,0,0,28.29,240.45,56.58,14.14,28.29,28.29,0.14,183.88,28.29,0,70.72,0,0,0,56.58,14.14,155.59,0,28.29,0,0,1,0.14,0.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0,1
10/17/14,6,B,LETTERS - Common sense left behind? ,"Blatant attack
Regarding ""Equal rights fight goes to pulpit"" (Page A1, Wednesday), I am dumbstruck that Mayor Annise Parker has authorized city attorney David Feldman to subpoena the lectures and writings of local pastors she suspects have spoken out against HERO, or the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. To say that such an action is heavy-handed is an understatement. Given the traditional American disregard for politicians who use the offices of government to harass individuals and groups, I would have expected our savvy mayor to approach this matter with a much more delicate hand. Instead, she bluntly unleashed her legal dogs on people of faith from across the political spectrum.
Feldman, in justifying Parker's actions, is quoted as saying: ""If someone is speaking from the pulpit and it's political speech, then it's not going to be protected."" Given the very large extent to which morality and legality overlap, this is a questionable assumption at best, but it also raises the question of why the city was attempting to confiscate ""all speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.""
With her actions, Parker made it clear that church leaders have no right to speak out on matters of public policy. What is disturbing is that she also apparently believes that they're not even entitled to express an opinion on such matters outside the pulpit.
Finally, we must speak of the blatant hypocrisy at play: The Democratic Party has openly campaigned for votes in houses of worship for decades and not a single instance drew so much as a stern word from Parker, much less a subpoena.
Pete Smith, Houston Guidelines
[This is] a clear attempt to chill the exercise of First Amendment rights of freedom of speech and religion. Under federal guidelines interpreting the First Amendment, pastors and churches can address any political issue. They are only restricted from advocating for individual candidates for office.
David Trawick, posted on HoustonChronicle.com Legal process
Regarding ""Officials distance selves from sermon subpoenas"" (Page B1, Thursday), when you sue someone, like this group of religious extremists did, don't be surprised when documents are requested by the other party as part of discovery. This is the most common occurrence in lawsuits; the religious right is making a mountain out of a mole hill and should have thought about this before they sued someone.

State law
How in the world are the city of Houston's subpoenas of the sermons and parishioner correspondence of pastors who oppose the city's equal rights ordinance not unconstitutional? The Texas Constitution, Article 1, Section 6, Bill of Rights states in part: ""... No human authority ought, in any case whatever, to control or interfere with the rights of conscience in matters of religion, and no preference shall ever be given by law to any religious society or mode of worship. ..."" and (Section 8) ""Every person shall be at liberty to speak, write or publish his opinions on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that privilege; and no law shall ever be passed curtailing the liberty of speech or of the press. ...""
The attorney general needs to address this. Robert E. Knippenberg, Wharton Persecution
City attorneys in subpoenaing sermons opposing the city ordinance - HERO - are engaged in the national and international war on Christians. The sermon is part of the liturgical offering of the sacred rite of worship. It is as much protected as is the seal of confession and no government official since Henry VIII has seen fit to obtain it under penalty of law. No pastor is obliged to surrender that text as part of the sacred liturgy speaking on a crucial moral issue of great interest to their congregation.
The pastors of Houston's churches must refuse to surrender these texts even under penalty of civil disobedience to any court order.
The time to confront this national war on Christians has come even at the price of a prison sentence. This civil disobedience shall have been a matter of conscience.

Oh, those commercials
Regarding ""HBO Go's move puts pressure on pay TV"" (Page D1, Thursday), more viewers are getting fed up with all the commercials we have to endure during a regular television show. There is less and less content and more and more commercials.

Regarding ""Bill would obstruct Clean Air Act protections"" (Page B7, Thursday), EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy once said this about the current air quality management process: ""I hate that each sector has 17 to 20 rules that govern each piece of equipment and you've got to be a neuroscientist to figure it out.""
Although I also do not agree with all of Congressmen Randy Weber and Pete Olson's legislation, I admire the fact that someone is finally suggesting foundational changes to the Clean Air Act.
The law is over 24 years old. It is in desperate need of simplification, expansion and modernization. I applaud the congressmen's courage, effort and leadership.
My hope is that environmental groups will suggest their own improvements to the Clean Air Act, and then we can all sit down together and figure out an even better Clean Air Act to better prepare ourselves for the problems and opportunities of the 21st century.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,937,85.21,50.87,12.35,22.91,22.85,27.32,82.28,60.19,48.88,7.58,3.42,0.75,0.75,0.43,0.64,0.64,4.16,14.73,6.94,1.28,15.47,7.26,3.2,5.76,1.39,12.38,6.51,4.27,7.79,1.39,0.64,5.76,11.21,1.71,9.5,2.13,1.17,1.39,2.67,0.32,2.99,0,5.02,2.56,2.35,0.96,0.43,0.43,0,0.32,0,0,11.85,5.76,0.11,0.53,0.75,0.96,2.45,5.76,0.21,0,0.53,0.11,3.84,3.31,0.32,0.21,5.87,0.75,0.11,2.03,0.43,2.67,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.11,0,1.07,0.11,0.43,0,0,0,0.21,0.32,0.43,3.42,5.87,0.32,0.85,4.16,0.53,0.11,0,2.88,1.92,4.7,1.81,0.21,0,0.11,0.11,0,16.54,5.66,5.34,0.11,0,1.28,4.16,0,0.64,0,0,0.11,0.21,2.98,3.33,2.69,3.13,2.64,-2.59,-0.82,0.21,-0.69,-1.1,0.64,0.21,0,0.43,1.6,0.11,0.85,0,1.07,0.32,2.35,0,1.6,0,0.85,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0.32,0,0,0.21,2.31,1.58,18.84,106.72,0.21,362.86,1.6,160.09,1.39,224.12,1.6,128.07,-0.43,266.81,0.43,437.57,0,149.41,0.21,160.09,1.6,10.67,0,53.36,96.05,170.76,32.02,0,32.02,0.21,160.09,74.71,0,74.71,10.67,0.11,0,117.4,53.36,213.45,10.67,85.38,0,0.85,1,0,0.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
10/17/14,6,Opinion,Our view: What pastors face in Houston is unacceptable ,"‚ÄúOnce a government is committed to the principle of silencing the voice of opposition, it has only one way to go, and that is down the path of increasingly repressive measures, until it becomes a source of terror to all its citizens and creates a country where everyone lives in fear.‚Äù ‚Äî Harry S. Truman (1950)
It‚Äôs hard to believe that pastors in the United States of America are having to deal with a censorship threat from government officials, but that‚Äôs exactly the issue in Houston, Texas. It‚Äôs causing an uproar among a growing number of clergymen, who rightly see it as an infringement of First Amendment rights.
The issue revolves around the Houston City Council approving a controversial new non-discrimination ordinance, which has led government officials to subpoena sermons and notes from pastors related to openly gay Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality or gender identity.
In response, some pastors are threatening to break the law if it‚Äôs not changed.
‚ÄúWe are recipients of a long heritage of boys whose blood was shed for the freedoms we have today. They have not died in vain. If the pulpit is not free, then freedom has been lost,‚Äù the Rev. Randy White, of the First Baptist Church of Katy, Texas, wrote in a blog. ‚ÄúThere is no middle ground on this one, no benefit of the doubt, no possible misunderstanding. I will not be silent. Send me to jail, confiscate my goods, or take my life, but I will not be silent. And, I am sure, I will not be alone.‚Äù
The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a nationally-known firm specializing in religious liberty cases, filed a motion on behalf of five Houston pastors ordered to surrender their sermons. ADF attorneys called the action by Houston‚Äôs City Council ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù and called this action a ‚Äúwitch hunt.‚Äù
David Gibbs, president and general counsel of the National Center for Life and Liberty, has asked Parker to tell her lawyers to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and immediately withdraw the subpoena. He described it as ‚Äúover-broad, inappropriate and unconstitutional.‚Äù
On Thursday, the state‚Äôs attorney general, Greg Abbott, called on Houston city attorney Dave Feldman to withdraw subpoenas requiring the five pastors to submit their sermons to his office in regard to litigation against a new Houston Equal Rights Ordinance‚Äôs protections based on sexual orientation. ‚ÄúWhether you intend it to be so or not, your action is a direct assault on the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment,‚Äù Abbott wrote to Feldman. ‚ÄúYou should immediately instruct your lawyers to withdraw the city‚Äôs subpoenas.‚Äù
In light of the negative responses, Houston‚Äôs mayor said she‚Äôs having a change of heart about the ordinance, according to news reports today.

10/17/14,6,Opinion,RODRIGUEZ: Houston was taking aim at our First Amendment ,"
In yet another frightening example of the liberal attacks on the Bill of Rights, the city of Houston tried to demand pastors in Houston turn over their ‚Äúsermons, speeches and other communications regarding ‚Äúhomosexuality, or gender identity.‚Äù
This action came after a lengthy and bitter political fight in Houston over a ‚Äúnon-discrimination‚Äù ordinance designed to protect homosexuals and lesbians from discrimination.
Under the guise of fighting discrimination against lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people (LGBT) any disagreement with their cause or issues has become classified as ‚Äúhate speech.‚Äù
Apparently, the religious preaching of traditional marriage between a man and a woman is now considered hate speech, and since it is hate speech, some felt the government must prosecute it to stop it.
In the original subpoena, the city of Houston has asked pastors for ‚Äúall communications with members of your congregation regarding Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) or the Petition,‚Äù and for ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.‚Äù
Houston LGBT advocates claim that churches and religious groups must stay out of politics because there must a separation of church and state, and because they are not taxed.
Using that logic, anyone who does not pay taxes should not vote (an idea which many conservatives could support), and morality or virtue should not be considerations in elections.
Jonathan Saenz, attorney and president of Texas Values, said ‚ÄúGovernment demanding that pastors turn over their sermons or possibly face jail time is outrageous.
Everyone knows that Mayor Annise Parker doesn‚Äôt respect our state laws on marriage, and now we know she doesn‚Äôt respect the First Amendment.‚Äù
Senator Ted Cruz has condemned the subpoena, saying, ‚ÄúThe city of Houston‚Äôs subpoenas demanding that pastors provide the government with copies of their sermons is both shocking and shameful. For far too long, the federal government has led an assault against religious liberty, and now, sadly, my hometown of Houston is joining the fight.‚Äù
Attorney General Greg Abbott asked the Houston City Attorney to withdraw the subpoena saying, ‚Äúyour action is a direct assault on the religious liberty guaranteed by the First Amendment,‚Äù and the religious people of Houston ‚Äúmust be absolutely secure in the knowledge that their religious affairs are beyond the reach of the government.‚Äù
It is frightening that any government officials, whether local, state or federal, would even consider punishing religious beliefs.
We must remember that the Constitution was designed to protect individuals from the government, whether it is liberal or conservative. An individual‚Äôs freedom and liberty must be protected from local, state or national governments.
This is yet another reason to remind voters that the defense of freedom and liberty starts in your backyard. Vote in your local elections.

10/17/14,6,National,"Ted Cruz, Houston pastors rally as sermon subpoena outcry intensifies ","Critics called Thursday on Houston Mayor Annise Parker to withdraw subpoenas for church sermons issued as part of a lawsuit over a transgender rights ordinance, while city officials attempted to downplay the outcry as overblown.
At a press conference at Houston's First Baptist Church, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz joined a group of local pastors in decrying the city's move to subpoena sermons and other communications related to a court battle over the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), also known as the ""bathroom bill.""
""This week, the government of Houston, Texas, sent a subpoena to silence prayers. The government of Houston, Texas demanded of the pastors, 'Hand over your sermons to the government,'"" Mr. Cruz said. ""Caesar has no jurisdiction over the pulpit, and when you subpoena one pastor, you subpoena every pastor.""
Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said in a statement that more than 25,000 people have signed an online petition in the last 24 hours asking Ms. Parker ""to immediately retract these demands and issue a clear statement in support of the free speech of all people.""
In a Wednesday interview with KHOU-TV in Houston, however, city attorney David Feldman called the outcry over the subpoenas ""ridiculous,"" adding that, ""It's unfortunate that it has been construed as some sort of effort to infringe upon religious liberty.""
""All this hysteria about how we're trying to infringe all because of the use of the word 'sermons' is really, really ridiculous,"" Mr. Feldman said.
Ms. Parker told KHOU-TV she hadn't read the subpoenas before they were issued. ""One word in a very long legal document which I know nothing about and would never have read and I'm vilified from coast to coast ‚Äî it's a normal day at the office,"" she said.
Ms. Parker's office released a statement Wednesday in response to the uproar saying that the mayor ""agrees with those who are concerned about the city legal department's subpoenas for pastor's sermons,"" and that the city will ""move to narrow the scope during an upcoming court hearing.""
But Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Christiana Holcomb said Thursday city officials have taken ""no concrete action to withdraw the subpoenas"" and described the city's move as ""simply more window-dressing intended to shield them from public scrutiny.""
""Furthermore, the subpoenas themselves are the problem ‚Äî not just their request for pastors' sermons,"" Ms. Holcomb said in a statement. ""The city is not off the hook from its illegitimate request for e-mails, text messages, and other communications in which these pastors, who are not even party to this lawsuit, may have disagreed with the mayor. The way to fix this is to withdraw the subpoenas entirely.""
The city issued subpoenas last week to five local pastors opposed to the ordinance, which requires businesses open to the public to permit opposite-sex bathroom use.
A pastor-led coalition had submitted a petition in August to place the ordinance before the voters, but Mr. Feldman ruled the petition inadequate because of irregularities with a number of signatures.
Members of the coalition, which had turned in three times the number of signatures required to put the ordinance on the ballot, filed a lawsuit in August challenging Mr. Feldman's decision. A court date on the petitions is scheduled for Jan. 19. The subpoenas included requests for sermons, emails, text messages, presentations and other communications related to the ordinance, the petition drive, homosexuality, the mayor, and ""gender identity.""
The ordinance, passed 11-6 in May by the Houston city council, forbids private businesses open to the public from discriminating based on ""gender identity,"" which is now a ""protected characteristic"" under Houston law.
Janice Evans, spokeswoman for the mayor, said in an email, ""As we noted yesterday, the action will come at an upcoming pretrial court hearing in the case.""
But ADF attorney Erik Stanley, who attended the Houston press conference, said the city doesn't need to wait for a court date to address the subpoenas.

10/16/14,6,Opinion,"EDITORIAL: Equal Rights, Indeed: Preachers should be able to say what they want about Houston Equal Rights Ordinance ","
Some preachers in Houston have expressed concern, with great reason, over subpoenas from the city that ordered them to turn over ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to (the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance), the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.‚Äù
The mayor on Wednesday issued a statement in which she claimed the subpoenas were issued by attorneys working pro bono (which literally means ‚Äúfor the public good‚Äù) for the city, and that neither she nor City Attorney David Feldman knew the subpoenas had gone out. That‚Äôs curious, considering Feldman had suggested in a Houston Chronicle story Tuesday that the sermons and other documents were relevant to the case if the pastors were promoting a political cause from the pulpit. But even if we take her word for it, the situation is still a little dicey.
Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative legal group, filed a motion Monday to object to the records request on First Amendment grounds, according to a Wall Street Journal blog post Wednesday. ‚ÄúCity council members are supposed to be public servants, not ‚ÄòBig Brother‚Äô overlords who will tolerate no dissent or challenge,‚Äù ADF senior legal counsel Erik Stanley said in the WSJ post. ‚ÄúIn this case, they have embarked upon a witch-hunt, and we are asking the court to put a stop to it.‚Äù
We tend to agree. Mayor Parker and the city are targeting pastors who have protested ‚Äî and called for a repeal of ‚Äî the new Houston Equal Rights Ordinance that has raised many an eyebrow, but dragging preachers into court based on the content of their sermons sets a dangerous precedent. The First Amendment to our Constitution states ‚ÄúCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;‚Äù it concludes with ‚Äúor abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.‚Äù

10/16/14,6,Faith and Family ,Houston backs off church sermon subpoenas in transgender 'bathroom bill' fight ,"
After calling church sermons ""fair game"" for subpoena, Houston Mayor Annise Parker backed down Wednesday from the city's effort to force local pastors to turn over speeches and papers related to a hotly contested transgender rights ordinance.
The city had asked five pastors for ""all speeches, presentations, or sermons"" on a variety of topics, including the mayor, and ""gender identity.""
The subpoena prompted a storm of criticism when it became public Tuesday. The pastors are involved in legal efforts to overturn the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also known as the ""bathroom bill.""
The pastors and their allies called the city's broad demand a threat to religious freedom and proof that gay and transgender rights bills can be used as weapons to demonize Christianity.
""The government has no business asking pastors to turn over their sermons,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican.
Ms. Parker's office initially doubled down in the face of such criticism but issued a statement late Wednesday saying the mayor ""agrees with those who are concerned about the city legal department's subpoenas for pastors' sermons.""
The statement says the city will ""move to narrow the scope during an upcoming court hearing"" and that city attorney David Feldman ""says the focus should be only on communications related to the petitions to overturn the ordinance.""
Joe La Rue, legal counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which has moved to quash the subpoenas, called the mayor's turnaround ""wholly inadequate.""
He noted that the city still appears to want some sermons and other documents related to the lawsuit over the petition drive, which the city rejected after saying too many of the signatures were invalid.
""These sermons, emails and texts have nothing to do with whether the coalition gathered enough signatures to qualify for the ballot,"" Mr. La Rue said.
The city's statement added that the subpoenas were issued by ""pro bono attorneys helping the city prepare for the trial regarding the petition to repeal the new Houston Equal Rights Ordinance"" and ""Neither the mayor nor City Attorney David Feldman were aware the subpoenas had been issued until [Tuesday].""
However, Ms. Parker, a self-declared lesbian, defended the subpoenas after she was aware of them, according to her Wednesday afternoon statement.
In a post on her Twitter feed late Tuesday, around midnight, Ms. Parker said that issuing subpoenas for sermons was appropriate if the pastors had been active in promoting the signature-gathering effort to overturn the ordinance.
""If the 5 pastors used pulpits for politics, their sermons are fair game,"" Ms. Parker said on Twitter. ""Were instructions given on filling out anti-HERO petition?""
Her tweets also chided what she called biased reporting and lamented ""how little fact checking is done.""
According to a press conference Ms. Parker gave Wednesday, ""the goal"" of the subpoena"" was ""to find out if there were specific instructions given on how the petitions should be accurately filled out. It's not about, 'What did you preach on last Sunday?'"" The subpoena controversy has erupted amid a battle over the ordinance, passed by the City Council in May, which allows people to use public bathrooms designated for use by the opposite sex. The measure is aimed at prohibiting discrimination based on ""gender identity,"" which is now a ""protected characteristic"" under Houston law.
A pastor-led coalition opposed to the ordinance submitted about 50,000 signatures, three times the number required, to force a voter referendum on the issue. Even so, Mr. Feldman ruled the petitions insufficient as a result of ""irregularities,"" which prompted four people to file a lawsuit challenging his decision.
Mr. Feldman also defended the city's effort to seize sermons at first in an interview Tuesday with KTRK-TV, the ABC affiliate in Houston.
""If they choose to do this inside the church, choose to do this from the pulpit, then they open the door to the questions being asked,"" Mr. Feldman said.
City officials came under fierce criticism earlier Wednesday for the sermon subpoenas. Mr. Cruz also called the decision a ""grotesque abuse of power.""
""For far too long, the federal government has led an assault against religious liberty, and now, sadly, my hometown of Houston is joining the fight,"" Mr. Cruz said in a statement. ""This is wrong. It's unbefitting of Texans, and it's un-American.""
Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys filed a motion in a Texas district court seeking to quash the subpoenas as ""overly broad, irrelevant, and cause undue burden or harassment.""
The motion notes that none of the five pastors subpoenaed is a party to the lawsuit.
The five pastors targeted by the subpoenas are Hernan Castano, Magda Hermida, Khan Huynh, Steve Riggle and David Welch, all of whom opposed the ordinance.
Mr. Welch, executive director of the Texas Pastors Council, said city officials appear to be interested in ""demonizing"" the pastors by finding something politically incorrect in the stacks of sermons, emails, presentation notes and other communications requested under the subpoenas.
Having said that, he said, ""Most of our pastors are not afraid, certainly on the basis of the sermon materials they're requesting.""
""Probably most pastors are thrilled to say, 'Hey, spread my sermons far and wide,'"" Mr. Welch said. ""It's not about the fear of giving them the content that's the issue here. It's that they're using the power of the sword to demand and compel [documents] that are inherently protected under the First Amendment, and we're not going to give that ground.""
Mr. Castano, who serves a largely Spanish-speaking congregation, told KTRK-TV in Houston that ""This is not what America, the nation, is about.""
""For a city government to step into the churches and ask pastors to turn in their sermons and all their speeches, it's gone too far,"" Mr. Castano said in a Tuesday interview. ""They want to put fear in our hearts. They want to stop the people from expressing the right that they have to oppose abuse of power in government, to oppose something that is not right.""
The documents named in the subpoenas include ""[a]ll speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.""
The subpoena also asks for ""All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the Petition.""
A court date on the lawsuit challenging the signature verification results is slated for Jan. 19, but no court has been set for the subpoena motion, Mr. Welch said.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1071,94.29,55.65,21.75,10.87,22.79,27.26,79.93,56.77,46.31,6.72,3.17,0.19,0.28,0.37,0.75,1.31,3.55,16.9,11.39,0.93,14.57,5.98,2.99,4.86,1.12,12.61,4.3,2.52,7.47,1.59,0.93,4.95,9.06,0.75,8.31,1.59,1.77,0.65,1.68,0.09,3.36,0,3.64,1.31,2.24,0.75,0.09,0.56,0.28,0.09,0.09,0,14.38,8.68,0.56,1.87,1.49,0.28,3.83,6.63,0,0,1.03,1.31,2.52,2.24,0.09,0.19,5.23,0.28,0.09,2.33,0.19,2.43,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0.37,0.09,0,0.37,0.28,0.19,0.19,0.19,0,0.09,0.28,0.28,2.61,8.31,0.47,1.4,5.79,0.47,0.09,0,2.89,5.14,3.73,0.84,0.19,0.19,0,0,0,22.88,5.7,7.19,0.19,0,2.05,7.75,0,0.09,0,0,0.37,0,2.98,3.3,2.93,3.35,2.51,-3.19,-2.13,-1.53,-1.43,-1.6,0.65,0,0.19,0.37,0.84,0.19,0.65,0,0.28,0,0.47,0,0.65,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.38,1.66,13.58,65.36,0.65,289.45,-0.19,177.4,0.84,261.44,1.77,84.03,-0.65,186.74,-0.56,168.07,0,158.73,-0.19,65.36,0.65,0,0,18.67,168.07,93.37,18.67,0,37.35,0.09,84.03,65.36,18.67,65.36,28.01,0.09,0,46.69,9.34,93.37,37.35,18.67,0,1.31,1,0.28,0.65,0,0,0.09,0,0,0,0.09,0.09,0.19,0,1
10/15/14,6,Life,Houston subpoenas sermons in battle over human rights ordinance ,"Religious liberty advocates are swinging back after attorneys for the city of Houston subpoenaed several area churches and pastors for sermons, emails and other communications allegedly encouraging support for a referendum to overturn the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
According to the Houston Chronicle, the ordinance initially contained a provision to open restrooms to all who identify with a given gender, but Mayor Annise Parker removed it from the final bill. Instead, Religion News Service reported, ""transgender people barred access to a restroom would be able to file a discrimination complaint.""
The City Council passed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance in May. The measure, commonly called HERO, is binding on city employment and contracting businesses that serve the public as well as private employers and housing providers. Religious institutions were exempt, the Chronicle reported.
Still, opponents launched a petition drive calling for a referendum vote on HERO in November. In August, Houston's city attorney rejected the referendum petitions as invalid, according to KTRK-TV. In response, conservative Christian activists filed a lawsuit to have the petitions declared valid.
That lawsuit prompted Houston's attorneys to subpoena ""all speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.""
The pastors served with subpoenas for their materials said they were not part of the referendum lawsuit. An earlier Chronicle report (paywall) suggested pastors in the city were ""divided"" on the provisions of the HERO measure.
And news of the subpoenas generated fiery reaction.
Russell D. Moore, president of the Southern Baptist's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, blogged, ""A government has no business using subpoena power to intimidate or bully the preaching and instruction of any church, any synagogue, any mosque, or any other place of worship. The pastors of Houston should tell the government that they will not trample over consciences, over the First Amendment and over God-given natural rights.""
Moore added, ""Our country deserves our allegiance. But no government can set itself up as our god.""
Arizona-based religious liberty law firm Alliance Defending Freedom has asked a court to issue an injunction blocking the city's subpoenas. The group said Houston's ""subpoena of sermons and other pastoral communications is both needless and unprecedented,"" according to litigation counsel Christiana Holcomb. ""The city council and its attorneys are engaging in an inquisition designed to stifle any critique of its actions. Political and social commentary is not a crime; it is protected by the First Amendment.""
The pastors themselves, Fox News columnist Todd Starnes reported, apparently aren't ready to cave. ""This is an attempt to chill pastors from speaking to the cultural issues of the day,"" Steve Riggle, senior pastor of Grace Community Church, told Starnes. ""The mayor would like to silence our voice. She‚Äôs a bully.""
Rev. Dave Welch, who heads the US Pastor's Council's Texas branch, and who was also served a subpoena, told Starnes ""We are not going to yield our First Amendment rights. This is absolutely a complete abuse of authority.""
 The issue of government involvement in what churches can and cannot say politically has been an ongoing matter of contention. In July, an atheist group said the Internal Revenue Service agreed to investigate churches allegedly making political pronouncements in violation of federal regulations. And in October, a reported 1,500 pastors engaged in ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday,"" an ADF-sponsored event aimed at provoking an IRS action that in turn would lead to a court case that would overturn the 1954 ""Johnson Amendment"" which created the IRS ban.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,592,95.31,54.18,9.25,34.49,18.5,36.66,78.04,51.69,42.57,5.07,2.7,0,1.01,0.34,0.17,0.68,2.36,15.88,10.3,0.34,13.18,5.24,1.35,4.9,1.35,10.3,4.05,1.69,7.43,2.03,0.68,5.07,9.97,0.68,9.29,0.51,1.35,1.69,2.53,0.17,3.89,0,3.04,2.03,1.01,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,12.67,6.25,0.51,0.17,0.84,1.01,3.55,6.25,0,0,0.17,0,5.57,5.07,0.17,0.34,8.78,0,0.17,3.38,1.01,4.56,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0.34,0.17,2.2,6.42,0,1.01,4.9,0.34,0.17,0,2.36,3.89,3.04,1.18,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,19.26,5.41,7.09,0,0,1.52,5.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.37,4.05,3.41,4.11,3.17,-2.77,-1.58,-1.2,-0.5,-1.41,0.17,0.51,0,0,1.18,0.17,0.68,0,1.35,0,2.7,0,1.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.26,1.5,16.68,236.49,2.03,405.41,-0.17,135.14,1.18,304.05,1.69,67.57,-0.34,219.59,1.52,270.27,0,185.81,0.17,219.59,1.86,16.89,0,50.68,152.03,101.35,33.78,0,50.68,0,67.57,50.68,0,33.78,16.89,0.17,0,101.35,33.78,118.24,16.89,33.78,0,0.68,1,0.17,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0,1

Pastor Dave Welch, one of five Houston pastors who received a subpoena despite not being involved the HERO lawsuit against the city, said in a phone interview shortly after mayor's statement was issued: ‚ÄúWhat they did by issuing these subpoenas was to punish any pastor in the city of Houston who participated in gathering signatures against the HERO ordinance,‚Äù
Welch, who heads the Houston Area Pastor Council, called even a downsized version of the subpoena ‚Äúan effort to both punish and intimidate those who dared to step-up and oppose this city council.‚Äù
The recently enacted HERO was championed by Mayor Parker, the nation‚Äôs first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city.
The city ordinance passed in June and bans anti-gay discrimination among businesses that serve the public, private employers, in housing and in city employment and city contracting. The ordinance exempted religious institutions.
But the ordinance passage was followed by a lawsuit against the city by people identified as Christians in the media. The
lawsuit sought a court injunction forcing the city to suspend the HERO ordinance and place a repeal on the ballot in November. City attorneys responded to the lawsuit on Oct. 10 by issuing subpoenas to five local pastors.
And that's when a local battle over discrimination suddenly became a First Amendment cause c√©l√®bre.
‚ÄúCity council members are supposed to be public servants, not Big Brother overlords who won‚Äôt tolerate descent or challenge,‚Äù
said Erik Stanley of the group Alliance Defending Freedom, which now represents the pastors, on the group‚Äôs website. ‚ÄúIn this case the city has embarked upon a witch hunt and we‚Äôre asking the court to put a stop to it.‚Äù
Part of the evangelical outcry now is the fact that the five pastors named in the subpoena have no involvement in the lawsuit brought against the city ‚Äì the city attorney issued the subpoena during the legal discovery process, according to Religious News
Service (RNS) and other news outlets.
Therefore it appears to some that these pastors have been singled-out because they allegedly fought the passage of the HERO ordinance from the pulpit.
The city attorney's office has not responded to requests for comment.
However, the subpoena was posted online by the attorneys at The Alliance Defending Freedom who represent the pastors. ‚ÄúThe subpoenas were issued to pastors who have been involved in the political campaign to organize a repeal of Houston‚Äôs new equal rights ordinance,‚Äù said Ms. Evans, chief policy officer to the mayor, in a statement to the Houston Chronicle. ‚ÄúIt is part of the discovery process in a lawsuit brought by opponents of the ordinance, a group that is tied to the pastors who have received the subpoenas.‚Äù
A central point of contention in the new ordinance is that if transgender people are barred access to a restroom, they may file a discrimination complaint.
The City of Houston subpoena specifically demanded the pastors turn over any all communications of any kind, written or electronic including but not limited to: sermons, emails, studies, petition circulars, training materials and any other related documents, photos and petition drafts, according to the subpoena.
The subpoena also demands, ‚ÄúAll communications with Pastor Dave Welch or anyone else at or associated with the Houston Area Pastor Council referring or relating to HERO, restroom access in connection with HERO, the Petition, or this litigation.‚Äù
Welch has become known for his conservative views and allegedly calling upon his followers to invoke ‚ÄúImprecatory prayers‚Äù that ‚Äúask God to burden, curse or even destroy wicked individuals and institutions,‚Äù against the LGBT community and its supporters, according to TFN (Texas Freedom Network)
Those failing to comply will with the subpoena will be held in contempt of court.
But the city's lawyers will face a high bar for proving the information in the sermons is essential to their case, Charles Rhodes, a South Texas College of Law professor, told the Houston Chronicle. The pastors are not named parties in the lawsuit, and the [US Constitution's First Amendment] ""Church Autonomy Doctrine"" offers fairly broad protections for internal church deliberations, he said.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,839,97.46,51.43,35.62,41.31,27.06,32.3,78.67,54.59,45.41,5.01,2.38,0,0.24,0,0.36,0.72,2.62,17.88,12.75,0.72,14.06,5.24,1.91,4.29,1.07,10.25,4.53,2.15,6.56,1.55,0.48,4.65,9.54,0.48,9.06,1.55,0.72,0.36,2.26,0.12,4.41,0,3.46,2.38,0.95,0.24,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,15.02,6.44,0.36,0.48,0.95,1.19,2.5,7.15,0.12,0,0.36,0.48,3.34,2.38,0.36,0.6,5.84,0.12,0.12,2.5,0.12,3.1,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0.12,0,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.48,0.24,1.91,8.94,0.36,0.95,7.27,0.36,0.12,0,2.62,4.65,2.26,1.31,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,14.66,3.81,4.89,0,0,1.43,4.53,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.12,3.39,3.82,3.31,3.8,2.76,-3.75,-2.12,-1.35,-1.45,-2.13,0.48,0.6,0.12,0.12,0.72,0.36,0.6,0,1.07,0,1.55,0.12,0.95,0,0.24,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0,1.49,0.75,16.12,131.11,0.95,309.89,0.95,95.35,0.6,154.95,1.07,83.43,-0.6,154.95,1.31,286.05,0,262.22,-0.36,107.27,1.07,0,0,35.76,297.97,35.76,23.84,0,71.51,-0.12,107.27,11.92,0,35.76,11.92,0.12,11.92,47.68,11.92,190.7,23.84,11.92,0,0.36,1,0.35,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0.12,0,1
10/15/14,6,Opinion,Preachers should be able to say what they want about ordinance ,"Some preachers in Houston have expressed concern, with great reason, over subpoenas from the city that ordered them to turn over ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to (the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance), the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.‚Äù
The mayor on Wednesday issued a statement in which she claimed the subpoenas were issued by attorneys working pro bono (which literally means ‚Äúfor the good‚Äù) for the city, and that neither she nor City Attorney David Feldman knew the subpoenas had gone out.
That‚Äôs curious, considering Feldman had suggested in a Houston Chronicle story Tuesday that the sermons and other documents were relevant to the case if the pastors were promoting a political cause from the pulpit. But even if we take her word for it, the situation is still a little dicey.
Alliance Defending Freedom, a national conservative legal group, filed a motion Monday to object to the records request on First Amendment grounds, according to a Wall Street Journal blog post Wednesday. ‚ÄúCity council members are supposed to be public servants, not ‚ÄòBig Brother‚Äô overlords who will tolerate no dissent or challenge,‚Äù ADF senior legal counsel Erik Stanley said in the WSJ post. ‚ÄúIn this case, they have embarked upon a witch-hunt, and we are asking the court to put a stop to it.‚Äù
We tend to agree. Mayor Parker and the city are targeting pastors who have protested ‚Äî and called for a repeal of ‚Äî the new Houston Equal Rights Ordinance that has raised many an eyebrow, but dragging preachers into court based on the content of their sermons sets a dangerous precedent. The First Amendment to our Constitution states ‚ÄúCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;‚Äù it concludes with ‚Äúor abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.‚Äù

10/15/14,6,National,"Houston subpoenas pastors' sermons in fight over ""bathroom bill"" ","Attorneys for several Houston pastors are challenging the city's attempts to subpoena their sermons as part of a lawsuit against the recently passed transgender-rights law, also known as the ""bathroom bill.""
The subpoenas ask the pastors to turn over all communications related to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, which was approved by the city council in June. A citizen petition-gathering effort to overturn the measure was thwarted after the city attorney said the number of valid signatures fell short.
Opponents of the ordinance, which forbids businesses open to the public from stopping individuals from using opposite-sex bathrooms if their gender identity doesn't match their biological sex, filed a lawsuit in August challenging the city attorney's ruling.
Alliance Defending Freedom senior legal counsel Erik Stanley said the pastors subject to the city's subpoenas are not party to the lawsuit.
""City council members are supposed to be public servants, not 'Big Brother' overlords who will tolerate no dissent or challenge,""
said Mr. Stanley in a statement. ""In this case, they have embarked upon a witch-hunt, and we are asking the court to put a stop to it.""
One of the subpoenas posted on the ADF website requires that the pastor produce ""[a]ll speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.""
The subpoena also asks for, ""All communications with members of your congregation regarding HERO or the Petition.""
In a Tuesday statement, ADF said that the citizens' groups submitted three times the number of necessary signatures, and that the city secretary certified them as sufficient. But city attorney David Feldman said the petitions included ""too many documents with irregularities and problems to overlook,"" according to an Aug. 4 report in the Lone Star Q.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,306,97.54,57.59,26.78,39.24,25.5,33.66,80.39,57.52,43.46,5.56,3.27,0,0.33,0.98,0,1.63,2.29,17.32,12.09,0.98,14.71,3.59,0.98,5.88,1.31,12.42,4.25,3.59,8.5,2.29,1.63,4.58,10.46,0.98,9.48,1.31,0.33,0.65,2.61,0,5.88,0,2.61,1.96,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15.03,6.54,0.33,0.65,0.65,0.98,2.94,8.82,0.33,0,0.33,0.65,2.61,2.29,0,0.33,5.23,0.33,0,3.27,0.33,1.63,0.98,0,0,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0.65,0,0.33,0.65,0.33,0,0,0,0.65,1.96,6.21,0.33,0.98,4.58,0.33,0,0,2.61,5.56,2.29,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,19.61,4.25,7.19,0,0,2.29,5.88,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,3.04,3.68,3.09,3.56,2.83,-2.63,-1.03,-0.74,-0.54,-1.38,1.31,0,0,0,0.98,0,0.65,0,1.31,0.33,0.33,0,1.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.37,1.26,13.06,130.72,0.33,294.12,1.63,228.76,0.33,130.72,0.33,65.36,-0.65,98.04,0,196.08,0,130.72,-0.65,0,0,0,0,0,261.44,0,65.36,32.68,65.36,0.33,65.36,130.72,0,32.68,0,0,0,65.36,32.68,163.4,0,32.68,0,0.33,1,0.65,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
10/4/14,6,A,These GOP hopefuls speak voters' language ,"Gilbert Pena has meandered down the sun-scorched streets of Pasadena for three hours with his straw hat, campaign literature and roster of doors awaiting a knock.
""Mi nombre es Gilberto Pena,"" the candidate for state representative says as the door creaks open. Then, halfway through his pitch, he forces himself to pause. ""Soy un Republicano.""
His mere hope after that admission is that the door remains open. It usually does.
Pena is fighting on a shoestring budget to defeat Mary Ann Perez, a freshman Latina Democrat who represents the majority- Hispanic House District 144 in east Harris County. Texas Republicans believe Pena to be one of their best chances to flip a Democratic seat this cycle, his fortunes bolstered by his last name and background: He may be a Republican, but he is a Hispanic Republican.
On the other side of the county in Houston's Vietnamese community, Republican Al Hoang is banking on the same dynamic in his race against another Vietnamese candidate for the District 149 seat.
In these two contests, both the Republican underdogs and Democratic incumbents share the same ethnicity as many of their voters, offering the GOP a chance to compete for voters the Democratic candidates considered their bases. And the Republicans are speaking conservative social messages in voters' native tongues to neutralize Democrats' demographic advantages and prove that they can more authentically advocate for their neighbors in Austin.
'Republican values'
""He is Vietnamese, so they thought he had Vietnamese values,"" Hoang said of his opponent, Rep. Hubert Vo, to Vietnamese- American voters about abortion here in Alief Village. ""I know they like Republican values.""
Vo, who disputes that characterization, is facing his first Vietnamese challenger since being elected in 2002. The district may be only about 20 percent Asian, but Hoang, a city councilman in this area before being ousted by many of those aggravated Vietnamese voters in 2013, sees them as his path to an upset. One side of his campaign literature that he gives to every voter stresses his patriotism - in Vietnamese. A push piece distributed by Hoang's campaign peddles unsubstantiated rumors to Vietnamese voters about his opponent's foreign policy leanings. And immigrants from Vietnam get a signed copy of Hoang's book, ""White Revolution,"" which offers the candidate's own Pacific platform.
Hoang acknowledges that a state representative has no authority over how aggressively the United States combats communism. Hien Do, an expert on Vietnamese politics at San Jose State University, said that does not matter.
""It's only been 40 years since we've been here,"" Do said of the community, which is about evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. ""For a lot of people, that is still a very raw wound, and they do not want to see the communist regime do well.""
That is a sympathy only a Vietnamese candidate like Hoang could express. The Republican Party had not specifically eyed a Vietnamese candidate to run against Vo, but the party has amped up its Asian-American outreach this cycle, hiring a staffer to focus solely on this demographic and building local Asian-American Republican groups. Hoang defeated another Vietnamese candidate in the May primary.
""We don't believe in racial politics,"" said Paul Simpson, chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. ""This is just an example of the Republican Party showing we want to have a presence in every community.""
While Hoang proudly proclaims himself as a dyed-in-the-wool Republican, Pena seems genuinely conflicted about whether to talk about his party on the stump: His literature features a broadside on Democrats' claim to represent the poor but also draws attention from the word ""Republican"" by including it in much smaller font.
Socially conservative
Like Hoang, Pena is emphasizing social issues to woo his Hispanic community, traditionally more socially conservative than other Democratic constituencies. Pena pillories the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance pushed by Mayor Annise Parker over the past year.
""I have always believed that a state representative should be a strong and proud leader that will stand for the CHRISTIAN and MORAL values of the people in the district,"" his literature reads.
Pena speaks Spanish to most voters he interacts with during his grueling, five-hour daily walks through the district. It is an old- fashioned campaign: Pena said he rarely walks with any volunteers or spends time raising money - he had only $2,000 on hand as of the last campaign finance report, compared to Perez's $85,000.
In a year with Republicans favored at the top of the ticket, the right winds could sweep Pena into office against Perez, who has benefited from support from such third-party groups as Battleground Texas and Annie's List.
Even as a Hispanic candidate in one of the more favorable terrains for a Republican challenger, Pena may at best eliminate the ethnic voting that could be seen if Perez faced an Anglo Republican. He still could suffer as Hispanic partisans break for the Democratic candidate - just as they do when neither candidate is Latino.
Issue neutralized
""They can make those ethnic appeals, but the Democrat in this case can make the exact same ethnic appeal,"" said Matt Baretto, who studies Hispanic public opinion at Latino Decisions. ""The fact that you're both Latino or both Vietnamese neutralizes that issue.""
Regardless, Texas Republicans say they see this as a long-term project.""
Melissa Fwu is the state party's new head of outreach for the Asian-American community.
""We're trying to get minority voters to get more involved in our party,"" she said. ""We're hoping this is a trend.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,912,86.38,70.59,3.65,32.38,21.21,26.64,80.37,57.13,47.04,9.76,6.03,0.22,0.66,0.11,3.29,1.32,3.73,16.78,8.44,1.54,14.36,6.58,3.4,4.5,0.66,12.39,5.37,3.4,5.92,2.3,1.1,2.85,8.55,0.44,8.11,1.21,0.77,1.43,1.75,0.22,3.29,0,3.73,2.3,1.43,1.21,0.55,0.55,0.11,0.22,0.11,0,13.93,4.61,0.33,0,0.44,0.22,1.64,8.66,0,0,0.11,3.18,11.07,7.13,4.06,0,3.07,0.77,0.33,1.43,0.55,0.11,0.66,0.22,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.44,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,0.33,0,3.4,6.91,0.22,0.99,4.82,0.77,0.11,0,2.41,2.08,4.5,0.77,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,17.65,4.71,5.15,0,0,2.08,5.7,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.44,2.37,2.36,2.44,2.48,1.99,-1.76,-0.33,0.44,-0.23,-0.61,0.77,0.22,0.22,0.33,0.22,0,0.88,0,0.22,0,0.33,0,0.11,0.33,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,1.54,1.33,22.89,186.4,1.86,274.12,0.66,186.4,1.86,131.58,1.32,76.75,-0.55,263.16,0.66,252.19,0,625,1.21,21.93,0.22,76.75,0,383.77,153.51,197.37,21.93,32.89,98.68,0.22,164.47,21.93,21.93,76.75,10.96,0.11,0,54.82,43.86,131.58,10.96,10.96,21.93,0.66,1,0,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
11/15/14,7,Forum,"McAlister: Houston, we have a problem ","HANS ZELLER, GAULEITER: You never answered the telegram ... from the Admiral of the Navy of the Third Reich.
CAPTAIN VON TRAPP: I was under the impression, Herr Zeller, that the contents of telegrams in Austria are private! At least, the Austria I know.
‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Sound of Music‚Äù (20th Century Fox, 1965) ***
I thought of that classic movie scene when I learned of the political thuggery out of Houston. This is not the Texas, or the America, that I know.
In case you have been sleepwalking, I‚Äôll review what has happened. Back in May, the City Council of Houston passed an ‚Äúequal rights ordinance,‚Äù which, in effect, accorded special privileges to gay and transgendered residents. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was nicknamed ‚Äúthe bathroom bill‚Äù because its most infamous requirement involves the ‚Äúright‚Äù of transgendered folk to use the public restroom of whatever gender they imagine themselves to be.
It is obvious real problems could arise here, as men could easily pretend to be transgendered in order to gain access to women‚Äôs restrooms to ogle women in varied states of undress, or worse.
Those who opposed this ordinance, who naturally included many Christians, collected some 55,000 signatures, many thousands more than were necessary to either force the City Council to repeal the measure or put the issue on the ballot. The city secretary certified the petitions. That did not satisfy Houston‚Äôs openly lesbian mayor, Annise Parker, and her cronies. Houston City Attorney David Feldman then enters the picture and, without legal authority, chooses to disqualify some 38,000 signatures due to technicalities.
Some residents then decided to sue. Mayor Parker and her associates decided to double down, which led to the fine mid-October day when news broke that five area pastors had been served with a subpoena to surrender ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession.‚Äù
As a result of this brazen and wholly lawless behavior by city officials, there has been widespread outrage and enormous pushback, as there should be.
But political oppression is the sort of thing one may plausibly expect from a representative (Ms. Parker) of a movement, the philosophy of which can be summed up in the words, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about me.‚Äù
Our Constitution, the laws of nature and nature‚Äôs God, the need for children to have both a mother and father, sexual modesty ‚Äî none of these things matter to Parker and her fellow ideologues.
The far left has cleverly found a way to conduct a ‚Äúlong march through the institutions‚Äù of our society over a period of several decades, and we are witnessing its bitter fruit. Unfortunately, too many conservatives have failed to be proactive in these battles. How much of the ideological turmoil we see today could have been avoided if, for example, conservatives hadn‚Äôt largely abandoned the universities to the left?
Our times demand much careful thought, action and, above all, prayer. We need to give our support to those, like Texas Attorney General and Gov.-elect Greg Abbott, who will go to the bat for our constitutional freedoms, as opposed to wholly artificial ‚Äúrights‚Äù that actually result in oppression.

Re: The letter ‚ÄúWhat was Mike Huckabee risking?,‚Äù A-J, Oct. 18.
Mike Huckabee does have great political courage to oppose ‚Äúgay marriage and abortion‚Äù in these days with some groups barking loudly over their desire to tear down traditional marriage and for the gay lifestyle to be accepted as equal with traditional marriage.
Ninety percent of the world‚Äôs population is heterosexual. Secular judges tearing down the will of the people is not right. The citizens of this country are in charge, not judges who side with the gay lifestyle.
Kudos to The Avalanche-Journal for printing their Quick Opinion about Mike Huckabee on Oct. 11. CEOs of big corporations (Mozilla is one) have had to resign because they are for traditional marriage.
We have a right to oppose same-sex marriage and abortion, and to publicly state those beliefs.
The LGBT community has a right to be any way they want to be, they don‚Äôt have a right to impose their lifestyle and beliefs on other people.
Example: The openly lesbian mayor and city council of Houston subpoenaed all speeches, presentations, or sermons related to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance from pastors who oppose gay marriage and abortion. The mayor and the city attorney trampled on their First Amendment rights.

11/13/14,7,Texas Opinion,TEXAS VIEW: A message of hate was conveyed with HERO‚Äôs demise ,"Supporters of Houston‚Äôs equal rights ordinance have to live with at least two depressing facts of political life in the wake of HERO‚Äôs demise: One, the numbers don‚Äôt lie, and, two, the architects of the campaign against the ordinance do. In fact, the campaign they mounted, successful to be sure, qualifies as the dictionary definition of ‚Äúbad faith,‚Äù a concept having to do in law and ethics with ‚Äúintent to deceive.‚Äù
Houstonians who voted against the ordinance may not have known it, but Jared Woodfill, Dr. Steven Hotze, Pastor Ed Young and other leaders of the anti-HERO campaign know full well that the ordinance had nothing to do with criminals invading women‚Äôs restrooms. They also know that fear works, and to act on their antipathy toward gays, lesbians, bisexuals and the transgendered ‚Äî the real reason for their opposition ‚Äî they were willing to use whatever tool available. Never mind that their successful effort besmirches a city known for its tolerance and inclusivity or that it could cost Houston economically as companies, conventions and potential residents reconsider whether this is a city they want to call home. Never mind also that it conveys a message of hate and intolerance toward the GLBT community. As far as the opponents are concerned, the ordinance had to go by any means necessary, including a bald intent to deceive.
Of course, there are legitimate reasons for opposing HERO. Mayoral runoff candidate Bill King contends, for example, that the city doesn‚Äôt need an extra layer of equal-rights protection. It‚Äôs a position we don‚Äôt share, but it‚Äôs certainly worthy of consideration. Promulgating fears about a so-called ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù was not a legitimate argument. It was nothing more than politics at their most cynical.
HERO supporters have to shoulder a certain amount of blame for what happened, none more so than Mayor Annise Parker. The first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city allowed the campaign for the ordinance to get personal, thereby deflecting attention from the broader purpose of an equal rights measure. A ham-handed city attorney‚Äôs office didn‚Äôt help, either. And, as it became obvious that opponents were willing to wage a scorched-city campaign of lies and deceit, proponents, including the Houston business community, were slow to respond, slow to point out the economic implications. And, finally, residents of Montrose, Meyerland and other areas of the city where the ordinance enjoyed strong support voted in paltry numbers.
Houston, the largest city in America without an equal rights ordinance, will have one, probably in the not-too-distant future after a new mayor takes office and begins repairing the damage. Meanwhile, the current mayor still has an opportunity to begin laying the groundwork for a retooled successor to HERO. She missed an opportunity during her embittered remarks on Election Night. We understand she was profoundly disappointed, and has a right to be, but the message she needed to convey, and must continue to convey, is that Houston is bigger ‚Äî and better ‚Äî than the election results suggest. She aimed at that during a follow-up press conference the day after the election, but that wasn‚Äôt in front of a national audience.
In this diverse city of more than 2 million people, fewer than 160,000 voters rejected an ordinance designed to protect the equal rights of all; slightly more than 100,000 voted in favor. The nays prevailed, but they hardly reflect the openness, tolerance and respect for difference that make us proud to be Houstonians.

11/12/14,7,News,Attorneys ignore First Amendment ,"Conflicts in Texas and Idaho in recent weeks have re-invigorated fears in conservative religious circles that expanding protections for LGBT rights will threaten their religious freedom.
In Houston, city lawyers obtained subpoenas requiring five pastors to turn over sermons and other communications that mention the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance. With assistance from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the pastors sued to nullify the subpoenas as overly broad and irrelevant to the case.
Meanwhile, in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, Idaho, the city attorney opined earlier this year that two Pentecostal pastors who run a for-profit wedding chapel called ‚ÄúHitching Post‚Äù must offer services to same-sex couples in compliance with a local ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in places of public accommodation.
A few weeks ago, the owners of Hitching Post ‚Äî again with help from ADF ‚Äî also filed suit to prevent city officials from forcing them to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies or face prosecution for violating the city‚Äôs anti-discrimination law. The pastors say they decided to sue after police officials contacted them about a complaint from a same-sex couple who were refused service by the Hitching Post.
In their zeal to uphold non-discrimination, city attorneys in both places were, to put it charitably, tone-deaf to the protections of the First Amendment.
The Texas controversy centers on an amendment to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) passed by the city council last May which, among other things, expands protections for gay and transgender people.
Opponents of the ordinance attempted to place a repeal on the ballot in November, but their petition was rejected for not having enough valid signatures. Four taxpayers then sued the city, claiming that the referendum petition was wrongly invalidated.
As part of the discovery process, lawyers for the city obtained subpoenas for communications relating to the anti-HERO campaign ‚Äî including subpoenas to five Houston pastors active in opposition to the ordinance, but not parties to the lawsuit.
The pastors were instructed to turn over ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons‚Äù related to HERO.
Religious leaders and civil libertarians from across the spectrum have spoken out against the sweeping scope of the subpoenas, pointing out that the First Amendment protects the preaching and teaching of religious leaders from government oversight or intrusion.
At first, Houston Mayor Annise Parker appeared to defend the subpoenas, tweeting that sermons on political topics were ‚Äúfair game.‚Äù But a few days later, she acknowledged that the subpoenas were overly broad and agreed to remove the request for ‚Äúsermons.‚Äù
The pastors and ADF, however, weren‚Äôt satisfied, arguing that the subpoenas would still require the pastors to turn over 17 different categories of information, including private communications with their church members.
Under pressure to reverse course, Mayor Parker announced this week that the city would withdraw the subpoenas entirely.
Coeur d‚ÄôAlene city officials also appear to have either changed their position or rejected the position attributed to the city attorney by publicly acknowledging that Hitching Post is exempt from the city‚Äôs non-discrimination law when performing religious marriages. Some commentators have compared the Hitching Post controversy to conflicts across the country involving wedding vendors such as florists, bakers and photographers who have thus far failed to get exemptions from non-discrimination laws. But whatever the merits of those decisions, Hitching Post is a very different case.
It‚Äôs true, of course, that for-profit businesses are places of public accommodation generally subject to non-discrimination laws. But ordained ministers ‚Äî whether in a non-profit or for-profit setting ‚Äî are protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment from being compelled by government to perform religious ceremonies that violate their faith.
If government officials in other cities want to avoid unnecessary conflicts and lawsuits like those that have divided Houston and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, they should think carefully how to protect First Amendment rights even as they work to implement laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.
Striking a balance between ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and upholding religious freedom will not be easy. As happens whenever competing claims clash in a pluralistic democracy, there will be winners and losers.
But surely Americans on all sides can agree on at least this: Under the First Amendment, religious leaders have the right to practice their faith ‚Äî including preaching sermons and performing religious ceremonies ‚Äî without governmental interference or intimidation.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,719,95.4,36.87,30.43,20.23,27.65,35.88,78.72,54.52,45.06,5.42,2.23,0,0,0,0.14,1.67,3.2,15.16,8.48,0.83,16.41,4.59,2.78,5.84,0.56,8.21,5.42,3.2,7.93,1.25,0.97,5.98,9.04,0.28,8.76,1.39,0.97,0.83,1.25,0.56,4.73,0,3.34,1.67,1.67,0.28,0,0.28,0.14,0.14,0,0,11.27,5.98,0.56,0.14,1.39,0.42,1.95,4.73,0.56,0,0.14,0,3.89,3.89,0,0,6.54,0.28,0.14,2.64,0.28,3.34,1.11,0,0,0,0,0,0.7,0.14,0,0.56,0.14,0.42,0,0.28,0,0.14,1.53,0.14,3.2,8.48,0.42,0.97,6.68,0.42,0,0,2.5,2.64,0.97,0.56,0.28,0.14,0.14,0,0,13.21,3.62,4.59,0,0,1.11,3.89,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,4.03,4.55,3.63,4.19,3.59,-3.42,-1.82,-0.78,-1.41,-1.53,0.7,0,0.14,0.14,1.95,0.42,0.14,0,1.25,0.14,1.67,0.28,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.47,1.37,17.75,125.17,0.83,319.89,0.7,166.9,1.11,208.62,1.67,166.9,-1.39,236.44,0.56,292.07,0,125.17,0,208.62,2.09,0,0,13.91,166.9,41.72,41.72,13.91,111.27,-0.56,97.36,55.63,13.91,27.82,13.91,0.14,0,55.63,27.82,139.08,27.82,0,0,1.11,1,0.41,0.68,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.41,0.14,0.14,0,1
11/8/14,7,B,LETTERS - Providing shade plus more ,"Tree violence
Regarding ""Respect the trees"" editorial (Page B11, Wednesday), as an environmentalist, I was feeling rather blue when reading the results of the mid-term elections knowing the fate of our natural world now rests in the hands of politicians, many of whom are at the mercy of rapacious developers and corporate polluters.
The editorial brought a bit of brightness to my gloomy outlook. Thank you for pointing out the public good Houstonians sacrifice every day for private profit.
Your editorial ended with the question, ""Who will speak for the trees?"" Indeed, I will speak for the trees as will many concerned citizens, including the stalwart Trees for Houston volunteers who planted those priceless trees more than 20 years ago.
I hope the city of Houston will aggressively pursue the perpetrators of this tree travesty and make them pay the highest fines possible under the law.
Not only will it hurt monetarily, it will send a strong message to those who come in the night with bulldozers and chain saws to destroy public property - or what is left of it in Houston.
Ann Hamilton, Houston Salient facts
After reading your editorial regarding the destruction of the oaks on Kirby by a Wendy's franchise owner, I feel compelled to offer my thanks to the excellent coverage provided by the Chronicle.
I'd also like to point out several salient facts about this incident that may not be apparent to those with a cursory knowledge of the issue.
First, this action was illegal. Trees For Houston regularly works with property owners, contractors and developers within existing statutes to ameliorate or remediate conflict between the built environment and our living infrastructure. This incident, while not anomalous, represents a disregard for public space and property not typically shared by most businesses.
Second, the city's track record under this administration, including their quick and decisive actions in this case, speaks of a new commitment to enforcing existing code.
Last, the Wendy's operator is neither a developer nor a contractor, and most certainly not a Houstonian.
TFH has found that local individuals and entities tend to take a longer view, and are often quietly doing ""the right thing"" when it comes to our trees.
So, by all means, condemn the cheaters and improve the statutes, but let's be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath water. Barry J. Ward, executive director, Trees for Houston
Test of character
Regarding ""Constable's 26-year tenure comes to a shocking end"" (Page A1, Tuesday), LULAC's district director Agustin Pinedo believes Victor Trevino's indictment is selective persecution? Trevino wasn't ""chased out of office,"" he is being held accountable for a crime.
Trevino has hardly been singled out. In the last year, we've read countless articles about authorities uncovering criminal activity in almost every level of office. These crimes were committed by people from almost every race, nationality and gender. Clearly, fraud is rampant among our leaders, and holding them accountable is our only hope of getting back on track.
Abraham Lincoln once said ""If you want to test a man's character, give him power."" Sadly, too many of our leaders are failing that test. Save the race card for when it's truly warranted; using it in instances like this only dilutes its credibility.
Susan Ellis Brittain, Houston Where's the love?
Regarding ""Ordinance draws dueling rallies,"" (Page A1, Monday), why would anyone who calls themselves a Christian not support a law that purports to provide equal rights and opportunities for anyone? Those who rallied at Grace Community Church in support of an effort to have a citywide vote on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance presumably oppose this measure due to the segment of society that the ordinance is designed to protect. Have they all forgotten the commandment to ""Love thy neighbor as thyself?""
As for the subpoenas issued requesting the content of sermons, speeches and so forth of those pastors who have been vocal opponents of the ordinance, I find it odd that they would object to their words being available in the public domain. Could it be that some pastors fear that their open stances on political issues expressed from their pulpits would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of their church?
Bill Bentley, La Porte Election interpretation
Regarding ""Red tidal wave for GOP"" (Page A1, Wednesday), now that the midterm elections are over, it will be interesting to see how the results are interpreted by the GOP and the media.
Tea Party supporters of Sen. Ted Cruz will argue that the election is a clear indication that President Obama's policies have been repudiated by the electorate and that programs such as the Affordable Care Act should be repealed in their entirety.
In Ohio, Republican Gov. John Kasich accepted federal funds to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and was re-elected with over 60 percent of the vote. Should this be interpreted to mean that GOP voters support the ACA?
The election results will have different meanings to people in different parts of the country. Even here in Texas, the city of Denton banned fracking, but that doesn't mean fracking should be banned in other parts of the country.
Since March 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added almost 10,000 points, and the economy has made significant improvements. The results of one election should not be interpreted to mean that the programs enacted over the past six years to strengthen the economy should be overturned in their entirety.

A walk in Clowney's shoes
Regarding ""Clowney not sure if he'll play vs. Browns"" (Page C5, Thursday), I had surgery for a tear in the meniscus a week prior to Jadeveon Clowney.

11/7/14,7,Opinion,"As LGBT rights expand, remember the First Amendment ","Conflicts in Texas and Idaho in recent weeks have re-invigorated fears in conservative religious circles that expanding protections for LGBT rights will threaten their religious freedom.
In Houston, city lawyers obtained subpoenas requiring five pastors to turn over sermons and other communications that mention the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance. With assistance from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the pastors sued to nullify the subpoenas as overly broad and irrelevant to the case.
Meanwhile, in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, Idaho, the city attorney opined earlier this year that two Pentecostal pastors who run a for-profit wedding chapel called ‚ÄúHitching Post‚Äù must offer services to same-sex couples in compliance with a local ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in places of public accommodation.
A few weeks ago, the owners of Hitching Post ‚Äî again with help from ADF ‚Äî also filed suit to prevent city officials from forcing them to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies or face prosecution for violating the city‚Äôs anti-discrimination law. The pastors say they decided to sue after police officials contacted them about a complaint from a same-sex couple who were refused service by the Hitching Post.
In their zeal to uphold non-discrimination, city attorneys in both places were, to put it charitably, tone-deaf to the protections of the First Amendment.
The Texas controversy centers on an amendment to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) passed by the city council last May which, among other things, expands protections for gay and transgender people.
Opponents of the ordinance attempted to place a repeal on the ballot in November, but their petition was rejected for not having enough valid signatures. Four taxpayers then sued the city, claiming that the referendum petition was wrongly invalidated.
As part of the discovery process, lawyers for the city obtained subpoenas for communications relating to the anti-HERO campaign ‚Äî including subpoenas to five Houston pastors active in opposition to the ordinance, but not parties to the lawsuit.
‚ÄúThe pastors were instructed to turn over ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons‚Äù related to HERO.
Religious leaders and civil libertarians from across the spectrum have spoken out against the sweeping scope of the subpoenas, pointing out that the First Amendment protects the preaching and teaching of religious leaders from government oversight or intrusion.
At first, Houston Mayor Annise Parker appeared to defend the subpoenas, tweeting that sermons on political topics were ‚Äúfair game.‚Äù But a few days later, she acknowledged that the subpoenas were overly broad and agreed to remove the request for ‚Äúsermons.‚Äù
The pastors and ADF, however, weren‚Äôt satisfied, arguing that the subpoenas would still require the pastors to turn over 17 different categories of information, including private communications with their church members.
Page 2 of 2 - Under pressure to reverse course, Mayor Parker announced that the city would withdraw the subpoenas entirely.
Coeur d‚ÄôAlene city officials also appear to have either changed their position or rejected the position attributed to the city attorney by publicly acknowledging that Hitching Post is exempt from the city‚Äôs non-discrimination law when performing religious marriages.  Some commentators have compared the Hitching Post controversy to conflicts across the country involving wedding vendors such as florists, bakers and photographers who have thus far failed to get exemptions from non-discrimination laws. But whatever the merits of those decisions, Hitching Post is a very different case.
It‚Äôs true, of course, that for-profit businesses are places of public accommodation generally subject to non-discrimination laws. But ordained ministers ‚Äî whether in a non-profit or for-profit setting ‚Äî are protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment from being compelled by government to perform religious ceremonies that violate their faith.
If government officials in other cities want to avoid unnecessary conflicts and lawsuits like those that have divided Houston and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, they should think carefully how to protect First Amendment rights even as they work to implement laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.
Striking a balance between ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and upholding religious freedom will not be easy. As happens whenever competing claims clash in a pluralistic democracy, there will be winners and losers.
But surely Americans on all sides can agree on at least this: Under the First Amendment, religious leaders have the right to practice their faith ‚Äî including preaching sermons and performing religious ceremonies ‚Äî without governmental interference or intimidation.

I just signed an Internet petition to stop sending tax dollars to nations that persecute Christians. It was addressed to both Congress and President Obama.

No BRAC
The head cheerleader for the Democratic Party, Frank Gadbois, needs to fact check himself while he continually talks about the √¨next√Æ round of BRAC. Let me be of assistance to him:
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 specifically prohibits authorization of future BRAC rounds: No future Base Realignment and Closure round for military installations within the United Sates, its commonwealths, territories and possessions for realignment or closure shall be authorized until, at the very earliest, the Department of Defense has completed and submitted to Congress a formal review of the overseas military facility structure, which incorporates overseas basing consolidations, an assessment of the need for bases to support overseas contingency operations, and the Department of Defense√≠s Strategic Choices and Management Review. In May 2014, it was attempted to fund another round of BRAC, although funding was not approved in a vote in May of that year.
With that being said, I√≠m sure Gadbois will still have plenty to complain about. -- Ron Renno

Real oppression
Houston, Texas, Mayor Annise Parker signed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance into law on May 28, 2014. The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions were said to be exempt. Violations based on denying individuals because of sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information or military status could be fined up to $5,000.
During the summer, collected petition signatures supporting repeal were invalidated, a suit against the city was filed and city attorneys subpoenaed sermons given by local pastors who oppose the law.
Parker√≠s actions are a barely veiled endeavor to silence the word of God, which stands contrary to her personal lifestyle and an increasingly depraved American society. Historically, such suppression has been tried by more potent powers than the Houston mayor. God and his word have adroitly triumphed over the persecutions of prison, fire and sword by Pharaoh, Pilate, Herod, Ananias, Caiaphas other religions and, yes, even other Christians. The mayor and City Council of Houston will, no doubt, be swallowed up by its own irrelevance.

Success the American way
I read an article yesterday written by former military veteran, mayor and congressman Jim Marshall published in The Telegraph, citing √¨Politicians should not lead business recruiting.√Æ After reading the point by point article, I enthusiastically endorse his sentiment in this instance; however, in regard to jobs being outsourced offshore, I do not believe that either politicians or businessmen can return goods production back to the shores of America.
In order to grasp this fundamental assessment, you only need to understand the underlying principles of √¨supply and demand.√Æ There are no existing factory, plant or manufacturing entities in America capable of getting their goods produced below labor costs prevalent in the offshore markets. Accordingly, it is impossible for America√≠s businesses to successfully compete against foreign competition in such an environment.
Federal Prison Industry Inc., (Unicor) off the top, may be the only entity in the U.S. that perhaps come close to matching prevailing labor cost in offshore markets.
However, the irony -- America doesn√≠t want to compete against this entity either -- given the lesser of the two evils, which one would you choose, offshore or Unicor?
Further, I cannot project any sustainable incentive in sufficient form to induce those American companies, opting to do business offshore to return to America. The rationale is just not there.
It would be wise that we come to grips with the status quo and pursue other viable options designed to create jobs here in Georgia and throughout America. Why should we punish them for doing what we taught them to do in our institutions of higher learning?
Be angry at the president, Congress, the policy makers if you will, but not at those excelling in the pursuit of the American dream. As consumers, we love the low prices we generally expect at Wal-Mart and other discount retailers, but, on the other hand, we criticize them for the venues they chose to produce its products. What hypocrisy.
To turn this corner, we need folks like Jim Marshall, with the requisite political and business savvy to lead Middle Georgia from the bottom to the top. We need to support and encourage the efforts of MEDC and other advocacy groups seeking to bring and sustain economic empowerment to the citizens of Middle Georgia. I would definitely like to see the leaders of such organizations come together as one body, bringing into its membership smaller communities such as Montezuma, Fort Valley, Baldwin County, etc., collectively pooling their resources to defeat the main issue of today: an unacceptable level of unemployment.
Is it possible to put egos aside and bring such an organization into existence? It can be reasonably generalized, that these smaller communities simply do not have the wherewithal to advocate for their respective survival. However, they individually and collectively do have resources (land) to bring to the table.

Tribute to law enforcement
I would like to give honor and thanks to the law enforcement personnel who serve and protect us. They leave their loved ones to go out to fight crime and enforce other laws. I feel empathy for the family in Monroe County who lost their loved one and for the family whose loved one was injured. I feel empathy for anyone who has lost a loved one who worked in law enforcement.
As an advocate against violence, I feel they are brave individuals for working in law enforcement with the high rate of violence and crime prevalent today.
I would like to give recognition to the officers who work the evening shift a the Medical Center who showed how helpful and patient many officers can be.

Red-light runners
There is a three second differential between one light turning red and the cross traffic getting the green light. That means for three seconds all four traffic lights are red. A red light means STOP and not √¨I have three seconds to make it through the intersection before the other lights turn green.√Æ That logic is flawed for two reasons:
1. Running a red light is illegal. 2. It is extremely dangerous. Some internal chronometers are a second or two off. I√≠ve seen people sail through intersections up to two seconds after the light had turned green for the opposite lanes.
Maybe the city, county and state police should stop hiding behind concrete lane dividers and bushes looking for speeders and try to stop red-light runners.

11/4/14,7,National,Thousands rally on behalf of Houston pastors hit with subpoenas ,"Thousands showed their support Sunday the five Houston pastors who drew national attention for challenging the city's now- withdrawn effort to subpoena their sermons.
I Stand Sunday, a combination church service and religious-freedom rally, drew an estimated 6,000 congregants to hear a high- profile line-up of speakers at Grace Community Church in Houston. The two-hour event was simulcast to nearly 700 churches and 3,000 home groups.
While the pastors were the focus, speakers warned that the Houston subpoenas represent only the latest example of a growing threat to religious liberty in the United States.
""This was never really about subpoenas, it was not about sermons or speeches. This was about political intimidation,"" said Family Research Council president Tony Perkins. ""It was about trying to silence the voices of the churches and the pastors.""
Houston Mayor Annise Parker dropped the subpoenas last week after a national outcry, but the issue is far from resolved. Members of a pastor-led coalition filed a lawsuit in August against the city attorney's decision to reject petitions for a voter referendum on the city's newly passed gender-neutral ""bathroom bill.""
""Mayor Parker, she's so committed to her own agenda that she's willing to trample on our right to vote, speak and practice our faith freely,"" said Khanh Huynh, senior past of the Vietnamese Baptist Church. ""My message to Mayor Parker, the city attorney and all those who have threatened our freedom is very simple: Let the people vote.""
Mr. Huynh, one of those served with a subpoena, said he was one of the ""boat people"" who fled Vietnam after communists took over his country in the aftermath of the Vietnam War.
""The freedom of speech and freedom of religion were among the first to be lost in Vietnam, and now I'm facing the same marching boot of tyranny right here where I live,"" Mr. Huynh told the crowd to cheers and applause.
Pastor Magda Hermida said the city's subpoenas for sermons, emails and other communications related to the equal-rights ordinance reminded her of the conditions she fled in Cuba more than 50 years ago.
""We used to live in Cuba in a police state in which our possessions, our speech, our faith were monitored closely by the government with the fear of punishment if we said something or did something those in power didn't like,"" Ms. Hermida said. ""We never thought we would see happening that is now in this country here in Houston, in our beloved America, but it is here and it is now.""
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said Christians need to become more involved in the political process. He said there are 80 million evangelicals in the United States, but only about half are registered to vote, and only about half of those vote in presidential elections.
""And we wonder why it is we're seeing the kinds of things we're seeing in cities like Houston, Texas,"" Mr. Huckabee said. ""I'll tell you why. It's because a lot of people in our churches have said, 'I just don't want to get involved.' My dear friends, when the government comes to your pastor and says, 'Cough up all of the sermons, sermon notes and correspondence that the pastor has had with his own parishioners,' you are already involved.""
Other prominent speakers included Ronnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention; Phil and Alan Robertson of A&E's ""Duck Dynasty,"" and radio talk-show host Todd Starnes of Fox News & Commentary.  A group of supporters of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO, gathered nearby Sunday for a counter-protest, holding signs that spelled out, ""Stand for Love.""
""You cannot use your faith as a blank check to discriminate against others,"" Tiffani Bishop of GetEqual Texas, which organized the demonstration, told the Houston Chronicle.
Although she withdrew the subpoenas, Ms. Parker has defended the ordinance, saying last week that, ""I don't want to have a national debate about freedom of religion when my whole purpose is to defend a strong and wonderful and appropriate city ordinance against local attack.""
Steve Riggle, pastor of Grace Community Church pastor, said the subpoenas have galvanized the religious community to push back against government intrusion into matters of faith. Several videos shown during the I Stand Sunday event featured business owners in trouble with the law for refusing to provide services for same-sex weddings.
""We've been in this battle regarding this ordinance for many months, but when the mayor decided to send subpoenas to all of us, it seemed like it was the match that was the ignition needed to raise a firestorm all over the nation,"" Mr. Riggle said.
He also announced that foes of the ordinance will gather at 11 a.m. Wednesday at city hall for a post-election rally.
""I'd like to see all of you and everyone you can bring to city hall to deliver the mayor a message, a really vocal message, and it's real simple: Mayor, let the people vote,"" Mr. Riggle said.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,828,86.63,78.92,25.51,23.28,25.09,24.15,83.45,60.99,48.43,10.14,6.16,1.33,2.05,0.85,1.33,0.24,3.99,15.58,9.06,1.45,15.1,5.8,4.47,4.83,0.85,13.89,4.83,3.5,7.85,3.74,0.6,3.5,8.82,0.97,7.73,1.09,0.72,1.21,1.09,0.36,3.14,0.12,3.62,1.93,1.69,0.85,0.72,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,15.94,6.88,0.24,1.21,1.09,0.12,3.62,9.42,0.12,0.12,0.97,1.33,4.47,4.11,0.24,0.12,5.19,0,0.12,1.21,0.12,3.86,0.36,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,0.48,0.6,0.12,0,0,0,0.72,0.36,4.47,8.94,0.48,1.09,6.4,0.72,0.36,0,3.99,6.76,3.62,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,20.17,4.95,6.4,0,0,2.66,6.16,0,0.12,0,0,0.12,0.12,2.89,2.99,2.99,3.11,2.43,-2.82,-1.09,0.04,0.06,-1.18,0.24,0.48,0.12,0.36,0.36,0.12,1.57,0,0.85,0.12,2.54,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.24,1.37,1.29,18.12,217.39,1.33,301.93,0.6,181.16,1.21,289.86,2.42,72.46,-0.72,217.39,0,265.7,0,169.08,0.36,205.31,2.05,36.23,0,60.39,289.86,120.77,24.15,0,60.39,0.12,60.39,108.7,0,0,24.15,0.24,0,120.77,12.08,48.31,0,0,12.08,1.21,1,0.24,0.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Religious leaders and civil libertarians from across the spectrum have spoken out against the sweeping scope of the subpoenas, pointing out that the First Amendment protects the preaching and teaching of religious leaders from government oversight or intrusion.
At first, Houston Mayor Annise Parker appeared to defend the subpoenas, tweeting that sermons on political topics were ‚Äúfair game.‚Äù But a few days later, she acknowledged that the subpoenas were overly broad and agreed to remove the request for ‚Äúsermons.‚Äù
The pastors and ADF, however, weren‚Äôt satisfied, arguing that the subpoenas would still require the pastors to turn over 17 different categories of information, including private communications with their church members.
Under pressure to reverse course, Parker announced this week that the city would withdraw the subpoenas entirely.
Coeur d‚ÄôAlene city officials also appear to have either changed their position or rejected the position attributed to the city attorney by publicly acknowledging that Hitching Post is exempt from the city‚Äôs nondiscrimination law when performing religious marriages. Some commentators have compared the Hitching Post controversy to conflicts across the country involving wedding vendors such as florists, bakers and photographers that have thus far failed to get exemptions from nondiscrimination laws.
But whatever the merits of those decisions, Hitching Post is a very different case.
It‚Äôs true, of course, that for-profit businesses are places of public accommodation generally subject to nondiscrimination laws. But ordained ministers ‚Äî whether in a nonprofit or for-profit setting ‚Äî are protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment from being compelled by government to perform religious ceremonies that violate their faith.
If government officials in other cities want to avoid unnecessary conflicts and lawsuits like those that have divided Houston and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, they should think carefully about how to protect First Amendment rights even as they work to implement laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.
Striking a balance between ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and upholding religious freedom will not be easy. As happens whenever competing claims clash in a pluralistic democracy, there will be winners and losers.

11/3/14,7,NA,"Inside the First Amendment: As LGBT rights expand, remember the First Amendment ","Conflicts in Texas and Idaho in recent weeks have re-invigorated fears in conservative religious circles that expanding protections for LGBT rights will threaten their religious freedom.
In Houston, city lawyers obtained subpoenas requiring five pastors to turn over sermons and other communications that mention the city's equal rights ordinance. With assistance from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the pastors sued to nullify the subpoenas as overly broad and irrelevant to the case.
Meanwhile, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the city attorney opined earlier this year that two Pentecostal pastors who run a for-profit wedding chapel called ""Hitching Post"" must offer services to same-sex couples in compliance with a local ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in places of public accommodation.
A few weeks ago, the owners of Hitching Post -- again with help from ADF -- also filed suit to prevent city officials from forcing them to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies or face prosecution for violating the city's anti-discrimination law. The pastors say they decided to sue after police officials contacted them about a complaint from a same-sex couple who were refused service by the Hitching Post.
In their zeal to uphold non-discrimination, city attorneys in both places were, to put it charitably, tone-deaf to the protections of the First Amendment.
The Texas controversy centers on an amendment to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) passed by the city council last May which, among other things, expands protections for gay and transgender people.
Opponents of the ordinance attempted to place a repeal on the ballot in November, but their petition was rejected for not having enough valid signatures. Four taxpayers then sued the city, claiming that the referendum petition was wrongly invalidated.
As part of the discovery process, lawyers for the city obtained subpoenas for communications relating to the anti-HERO campaign -- including subpoenas to five Houston pastors active in opposition to the ordinance, but not parties to the lawsuit.

11/2/14,7,NA,Protecting the church from the state ,"Much has been made about the importance of keeping church and state separate - such as the dozens of lawsuits over the years from civil libertarians to keep Nativity scenes or the Ten Commandments as far from government property as possible.
Almost invariably, the focus in such controversy has been on how to keep the church out of the state, not the other way around. Until now.
It seems now the focus needs to be keeping the state - or more specifically, state and local governments - out of the churches. Consider these recent cases in point:
* In Houston, five Christian pastors were served with subpoenas by city prosecutors to turn over emails and transcripts of sermons addressing homosexuality.
The city earlier this year passed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, providing broad anti-discrimination protections to gay and transgendered residents. Both a lawsuit and a petition gathering signatures to repeal the law ensued, and the pastors - who weren't involved in the lawsuit but did support the signature drive - were issued subpoenas, with Houston Mayor Annise Parker tweeting the emails and sermon transcripts were ""fair game.""
* In Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, the owners of the Hitching Post Wedding Chapel were told their refusal to perform same-sex weddings violated the city's non-discrimination ordinance.
Warren Wilson, the city attorney, told an Idaho paper that the chapel ""would probably be considered a place of public accommodation"" and would therefore ""be subject to the ordinance."" This is in spite of the facts the chapel is registered as a ""religious corporation"" with the state and the stated mission of the owners - a husband and wife who are both ordained Pentecostal ministers - is to perform ""one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.""
* In California, elective abortion is now deemed part of ""basic health services"" that all insurance plans must cover - including the plans bought and provided by churches for their clergy and staff.
This all comes from regulatory changes, as the state's Department of Managed Health Care - prompted by the American Civil Liberties Union - has reinterpreted a four-decade-old state law on health services covered by insurance, now ordering abortion be covered by all plans. Ironically, California's DMHC - along with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services - exempt churches from any contraceptive mandates, yet they've now issued a no-exception abortion mandate.
It's disappointing, but not surprising, that many of the same groups and individuals who protest even the slightest religious acknowledgement in public affairs are silent with regard toward these unwelcome intrusions of the state into church matters. Many are unsympathetic to religious stances to same-sex marriage, homosexuality and abortion, given that all three are becoming increasingly accepted in secular society. But even though all may have won several sizable legal battles both here and abroad, the practices remain contradictory to doctrines and principles of many of the world's most prominent religions.
In theory, those religious principles and practices are protected by the First Amendment. In reality, however, protections for religious conscience are proving to be woefully inadequate. The presumption seems to be that the free exercise of religion is only acceptable if it can justify itself in the eyes of the state. That's contrary to both the letter and spirit of the U.S. Constitution.
We recognize the importance of keeping government from being dominated by religion, but the threat today is not creeping theocracy, but rather government insertion into private matters of religious faith. The First Amendment that was written to prevent the ""establishment of religion"" also forbids ""prohibiting the free exercise thereof."" If that doesn't protect matters of conscience unpopular with the day's latest trends and causes, then those words have no meaning.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,605,92.89,40.06,21.21,22.28,26.3,30.91,84.13,60,49.09,4.3,1.16,0,0.17,0,0,0.5,3.14,17.36,9.92,0.83,15.21,6.94,3.47,6.61,0.99,11.9,5.95,4.46,6.28,1.82,0.99,3.47,11.24,0.99,10.25,2.98,0.99,1.16,2.15,0.33,3.47,0,4.3,2.15,1.98,0.66,0,0.5,0.17,0.17,0.17,0,7.93,3.8,0.33,0.17,0.66,0.33,1.49,4.3,0.99,0,0.33,0.17,3.64,2.98,0.33,0.33,7.93,0.17,0.17,2.31,0.5,4.79,2.15,1.32,0,0,0,0,1.16,0,0,0.33,0,0.5,0.17,0,0,0.17,1.32,0,3.31,6.78,0.5,0.66,5.45,0.17,0.17,0,2.31,3.97,4.79,0.66,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,17.69,4.46,4.46,0,0,1.82,6.94,0,0.5,0,0,0.17,0,3.27,3.68,3.11,3.42,3.03,-1.75,-0.64,0.62,-0.21,-1.87,0.66,0.17,0.83,0.17,0.99,0,0.33,0,0.99,0,3.47,0,1.65,0.66,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,1.77,1.49,18.23,165.29,0.33,247.93,0.99,148.76,0.66,181.82,0.99,165.29,0.33,148.76,0.83,280.99,0,49.59,-0.17,347.11,3.14,0,0,66.12,280.99,132.23,66.12,0,82.64,0.33,181.82,0,16.53,16.53,33.06,0,0,82.64,33.06,165.29,16.53,33.06,0,0.99,1,0,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,1
11/2/14,7,NA,Sermons are free speech too - WHITE: Houston steps over the line in questioning pastors' sermons ,"
IN SOME countries, authorities stifle political and social dissent-countries like Egypt and Sri Lanka and Saudi Arabia and Iran. Now you can add the United States to that list. Because in Houston, we have a problem.
Last summer, the Houston City Council passed an ordinance called HERO, or Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of ""sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy"" in housing, private employment, public accommodations, public contracting and several other categories.
Some people objected, finding the ordinance overly broad. Did it mean, for example, that a biological male who considers himself female (gender identity) could use a women's rest-room (public accommodations)?
Maybe, maybe not. Still, opponents circulated a petition to place the ordinance on the ballot so voters could choose to keep it or overturn it. City officials rejected the petition, throwing out pages and pages of signatures they found irregular. Opponents filed a lawsuit. And then things got really ugly.
In September, the city attorney issued ""discovery"" subpoenas to five Houston pastors requiring them to submit all ""speeches, presentation, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity, prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession."" It further requested all ""documents or communications to, from, CCing, BCCing, or forwarded to you, or otherwise in your possession, referring to"" the mayor, city attorney, HERO, the Petition, etc.
Has anyone in Houston seen the First Amendment lately? You know, the one about freedom of religion and speech? Because your government has apparently misplaced it. Or hasn't read it for a while. The subpoenas were so intrusive, so invasive, they clearly had one purpose: to make it so costly for pastors to speak out about a cultural practice or ordinance they believe is wrong that it would silence all but the most bold.
Although threatened with contempt of court, the pastors balked at complying. Good for them. Because government power brokers had just crossed a line. (I'd invoke the Nazis here, who forced their will on the German church, but I've always thought that should be a last resort. I will recommend, however, you look up one word: Bonhoeffer.)
Now it's true that after an uproar, the Houston subpoenas were rewritten and the word ""sermons"" taken out. The city's excuse for the ""mistake"" was that the expansive orders were composed by an outside, pro bono group. An activist group, in other words, which would love to shut up opponents. Especially pastors. But simply taking out the word ""sermons"" doesn't weaken the oppressive effect of the subpoenas. Isn't a sermon a speech?
Some might argue that pastors and churches shouldn't be involved in politics. But how would that have played out in the civil rights era? Should the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. have just remained quiet? Or back further, during the slavery debates, should Falmouth abolitionist Moncure Daniel Conway have shrugged his shoulders at that great evil? From its very beginnings, America has benefited from the checks and balances that come from a robust application of all three First Amendment rights: freedom of religion and of speech and a free press. Because sometimes what's popular and or politically correct just isn't right.
Ah, but it's a dangerous thing to allow liberty free rein in a society. All kinds of things might happen. People may question government. Get all up in arms about what city councils want to do. Think for themselves. Discover the truth.
Last month, Peter Kirsanow, a commissioner with the United States Commission on Civil Rights, wrote a letter to Mayor Parker, asking that she instruct the city attorney to withdraw the subpoenas, calling them clearly overbroad and destined to have a chilling effect on political and religious speech. He writes, ""A person's religious views on civil rights, equal rights, homosexuality, and gender identity have nothing to do with whether there are enough valid signatures to place a referendum on the ballot. This discovery request impermissibly probes the religious beliefs of private citizens simply because they supported a political effort.""
And finally, just last week, Houston saw the light. On Wednesday, Parker instructed the city's legal department to withdraw the subpoenas.
Amen. Look, I understand this issue is sensitive. You and I may never personally agree on gender issues, along with abortion, premarital sex, dog breed bans, whiskey, HOA covenants and/or the Redskins. But the day government tries to shut you up, the day it uses the power of the courts to intimidate you and keep you from expressing your beliefs, on that day I will advocate for you. Because when we lose the First Amendment, we've lost America.

11/1/14,7,KS Opinion,"INSIDE THE FIRST AMENDMENT ‚Äî Charles C. Haynes - As LGBT rights expand, remember the First Amendment ","Conflicts in Texas and Idaho in recent weeks have re-invigorated fears in conservative religious circles that expanding protections for LGBT rights will threaten their religious freedom.
In Houston, city lawyers obtained subpoenas requiring five pastors to turn over sermons and other communications that mention the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance. With assistance from the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the pastors sued to nullify the subpoenas as overly broad and irrelevant to the case.
Meanwhile, in Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, Idaho, the city attorney opined earlier this year that two Pentecostal pastors who run a for-profit wedding chapel called ‚ÄúHitching Post‚Äù must offer services to same-sex couples in compliance with a local ordinance banning discrimination based on sexual orientation in places of public accommodation.
A few weeks ago, the owners of Hitching Post ‚Äî again with help from ADF ‚Äî also filed suit to prevent city officials from forcing them to perform same-sex wedding ceremonies or face prosecution for violating the city‚Äôs anti-discrimination law. The pastors say they decided to sue after police officials contacted them about a complaint from a same-sex couple who were refused service by the Hitching Post.
In their zeal to uphold non-discrimination, city attorneys in both places were, to put it charitably, tone-deaf to the protections of the First Amendment.
The Texas controversy centers on an amendment to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) passed by the city council last May which, among other things, expands protections for gay and transgender people.
Opponents of the ordinance attempted to place a repeal on the ballot in November, but their petition was rejected for not having enough valid signatures. Four taxpayers then sued the city, claiming that the referendum petition was wrongly invalidated.
As part of the discovery process, lawyers for the city obtained subpoenas for communications relating to the anti-HERO campaign ‚Äî including subpoenas to five Houston pastors active in opposition to the ordinance, but not parties to the lawsuit.
‚ÄúThe pastors were instructed to turn over ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons‚Äù related to HERO.
Religious leaders and civil libertarians from across the spectrum have spoken out against the sweeping scope of the subpoenas, pointing out that the First Amendment protects the preaching and teaching of religious leaders from government oversight or intrusion.
At first, Houston Mayor Annise Parker appeared to defend the subpoenas, tweeting that sermons on political topics were ‚Äúfair game.‚Äù But a few days later, she acknowledged that the subpoenas were overly broad and agreed to remove the request for ‚Äúsermons.‚Äù
The pastors and ADF, however, weren‚Äôt satisfied, arguing that the subpoenas would still require the pastors to turn over 17 different categories of information, including private communications with their church members.
Under pressure to reverse course, Mayor Parker announced this week that the city would withdraw the subpoenas entirely.
Coeur d‚ÄôAlene city officials also appear to have either changed their position or rejected the position attributed to the city attorney by publicly acknowledging that Hitching Post is exempt from the city‚Äôs non-discrimination law when performing religious marriages.
Some commentators have compared the Hitching Post controversy to conflicts across the country involving wedding vendors such as florists, bakers and photographers who have thus far failed to get exemptions from non-discrimination laws. But whatever the merits of those decisions, Hitching Post is a very different case.
It‚Äôs true, of course, that for-profit businesses are places of public accommodation generally subject to non-discrimination laws. But ordained ministers ‚Äî whether in a non-profit or for-profit setting ‚Äî are protected by the Free Exercise and Free Speech clauses of the First Amendment from being compelled by government to perform religious ceremonies that violate their faith.
If government officials in other cities want to avoid unnecessary conflicts and lawsuits like those that have divided Houston and Coeur d‚ÄôAlene, they should think carefully how to protect First Amendment rights even as they work to implement laws protecting LGBT people from discrimination.

Striking a balance between ending discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and upholding religious freedom will not be easy. As happens whenever competing claims clash in a pluralistic democracy, there will be winners and losers.
But surely Americans on all sides can agree on at least this: Under the First Amendment, religious leaders have the right to practice their faith ‚Äî including preaching sermons and performing religious ceremonies ‚Äî without governmental interference or intimidation.

12/31/14,8,A,"HOUSTON 2014: THE YEAR IN REVIEW - POLITICS, IMMIGRATION HERALD BIG CHANGES - Election drama, tragic losses and tears of joy all played out as oil prices plummeted ","Amid the daily rumble of a great city, the news can swing from quiet lows to crashing crescendos.
This year brought us November's raucous election, outbursts surrounding the city's controversial equal rights amendment, rising indignation over potentially violent sex offenders being housed in a residential neighborhood, and an ominous sucking sound as the price of crude oil plunged precipitously, probably taking with it a quarter-million jobs from Texas and other oil-producing states.
There was the sound of silence, of mourning, too, as six Spring residents and four Cypress residents were slain in their homes and four workers of a LaPorte chemical plant were fatally overcome by an escaping cloud of toxic gas.
The news struck notes of surprise as a top Texas criminal courts judge announced that he opposes the death penalty, and brought peals of joy as wedding bells rang for Mayor Annise Parker and her life partner of more than 20 years.
These are the stories that brought Houston to great highs and lows in 2014: Houston Equal Rights Ordinance
As contention reached a fever pitch, the Houston City Council in May voted 11-6 to extend equal rights protections to gay and transgender residents. The measure, supported by Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city, was greeted with applause from supporters who packed the chamber. Opponents responded with a petition drive calling for a referendum on the ordinance, which duplicates federal laws banning discrimination based on sex, race, age, disability and other factors. When city officials ruled thousands of petition signatures invalid, ordinance foes sued. A trial is set for January.
Stay family killings
Six members of a Spring family, including four children, were slain in an execution-style shooting in July when, authorities allege, a former member of their extended family came searching for his ex-wife, who was not in the home. Killed were Stephen Stay, 39; his wife, Katie, 34; and their children, Bryan, 13; Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7; and Zach, 4. Another child, Cassidy, 15, suffered a minor head wound. Authorities said Ron Haskell, 33, disguised as a FedEx delivery man, forced his way into the home, tied up family members, then shot them. He has been charged with capital murder.
Cypress family slain
A quiet neighborhood in suburban Cypress was rocked in January when the bodies of Maoye Sun, 50; his wife, Mei Xie, 49; and their sons, Timothy, 9; and Xiao, 7; were found shot to death in their home. The bodies were discovered when Sun, an employee of a Houston oil field equipment maker, failed to appear at work. Each of the victims, whose bodies were found in separate parts of the house, was shot in the head. No arrests have been made.
GOP juggernaut
Texas continued its love affair with the Republican Party in November when former Attorney General Greg Abbott led the GOP juggernaut by defeating former Fort Worth Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis with 59 percent of the vote. Fueled by anti-Obama sentiment, the trend continued with Houston state Sen. Dan Patrick's victorious campaign for lieutenant governor. He won 58 percent of the votes over San Antonio state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte. Republicans also claimed attorney general, land commissioner, comptroller and other top statewide positions. Election 2014 marked the first time in 24 years that an incumbent governor did not seek re-election.
Astrodome redux
Once the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" Houston's fabled Astro‚Äãdome got an influential endorsement for redevelopment in December from the Urban Land Institute, which argued the stadium should be converted into an indoor park with lawns, gardens, a promenade of oak trees and exhibit space for festivals and community events. The Dome's future has been in question since 2013 when voters defeated a proposed (SEE UNPUBLISHED CORRECTION) $217 bond issue for its redevelopment. County Judge Ed Emmett said the proposal from the urban planners, economics and designers,has ""almost a 100 percent chance"" of succeeding.
DuPont deaths
Four workers at DuPont's 800-acre plant in La Porte died in November when a faulty valve released a toxic chemical used to make insecticides. Killed when methyl mercaptan escaped from the containment vessel were Crystle Wise, 53; Wade Baker, 60; and Gilbert Tisnado, 48, and his brother, Robert Tisnado, 39. The younger Tisnado and Baker rushed into the gas-filled area without gas masks after they heard a woman's cry for help. When radio contact with them was lost, Gilbert Tisnado donned a gas mask and also entered the deadly area. Finding his brother overcome by the fumes, he removed his gas mask to render aid and also perished.
Roilings In oil
Soaring U.S. oil output, spurred by hydraulic fracturing and a refusal by OPEC to curb production, created a fuel glut that had producers scrambling to cut costs and employees. Oil futures plunged 46 percent in 2014, with Brent Crude for February delivery dropping to $58.36 a barrel on Monday. Analysts say the bearish turn in the oil business likely will persist through the first half of 2015. Texas and seven other oil-producing states could lose up to 250,000 jobs in that period. The glut, however, has put a smile on the face of American motorists, though, with the cost of regular gasoline at its lowest point since 2008. AAA reports that average cost per gallon hovers at $2.30 a gallon.
Top judge opposes executions
Texas Court of Appeals Justice Tom Price in November became the first judge on the state's highest criminal court to publicly oppose the death penalty. The Dallas Republican's concerns, which centered on the chance of executing an innocent person, were voiced in a dissent to a court decision clearing the way for the Dec. 3 execution of Kerr County double-killer Scott Panetti. The U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed Panetti's execution hours before he was to be put to death. Panetti, said to be schizophrenic, was convicted of fatally shooting his wife's parents.
For whom the wedding bells toll
Mayor Annise Parker in January married Kathy Hubbard, her life partner of 23 years, in a private ceremony in Palm Springs, Calif. ""This is a very happy day for us,"" Parker said. ""Kathy has been by my side for more than two decades, helping to raise a family, nurture my political career and all of the other ups and downs and life events that come with a committed relationship."" Parker, 56, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city, has been Houston's top municipal executive since 2010. In 2012, she joined 78 American mayors in calling for equal marriage rights for gay couples.
Unaccompanied minors
Texas saw a flood of unaccompanied minors from Latin American countries trying to cross the border, prompting complaints about immigration enforcement as well as pleas for assistance. Harris County in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 received the largest number of unaccompanied Central American minors placed with private sponsors by the U.S. Office of Refugee Settlement. Of the 53,518 youngsters placed with sponsors during that period, 4,028 came to Harris County. More than 85,000 unaccompanied minors were intercepted entering the U.S. since Oct. 1, 2009. The influx prompted President Barack Obama to advocate expedited screening and deportation. In September, Houston clergy with The Metropolitan Organization called for the city to put out the welcome mat to those fleeing Latin American violence.
Sex offenders Texas Office of Violent Sex Offender Management was hit by scandal in April after 23 offenders in civil commitment - a process in which inmates who have completed sentences are retained because they are too dangerous to release - were placed, unannounced to neighbors or political representatives, in Houston's Acres Home neighborhood. In the resulting uproar, the agency was reviewed, Gov. Rick Perry fired the agency's board chairman and the agency director resigned. In September, agency officials in response to a Houston Chronicle inquiry, also admitted they were unaware that Texas courts had freed two potentially violent sex offenders on the condition that they leave Texas. One was sent to Utah, the other to Virginia. Both since have been convicted of additional sex crimes.
Voter seesaw
First it was on, then it was off, then it was on. Legal wrangling over Texas' controversial voter ID law, enacted in 2013, might have left voters' heads spinning as, on Oct. 9, a Corpus Christi U.S. District Judge declared the law unconstitutional. The law, he said, would effectively disenfranchise hundreds of thousands minority voters. Five days later, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the ruling, saying that a change just days before the general election would confuse voters. The law requires voters to present a valid picture ID. On Oct. 18, the U.S. Supreme Court backed up the New Orleans appeals court without specifying the reasons. Turnout in the election was about 5 percent less than in the previous gubernatorial election - and the role the law played in the decrease continues to be debated.
Up, up and away
Space X, the first private con-cern to ferry supplies to the International Space Station, in August announced it had chosen Boca Chica Village near Brownsville as the site for its fourth space launch facility. Construction on the approximately $100 million facility began in September, and the first flights could launch as early as 2016. Elon Musk, CEO of Space X, says the site will be used to launch the company's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles and a variety of reusable suborbital launch vehicles.
Need a lift?
Sixteen months of gear-grinding controversy lurched to a halt in August when the City Council voted 10-5 to open Houston's heavily regulated paid ride market to new entrants such as Uber and Lyft. Such services use smartphone applications to connect willing drivers, who use their personal vehicles, with interested riders.
Alfred Dewayne Brown
Sentenced to die for the April 2003 murders of store clerk Alfredia Jones and Houston police officer Charles Clark, Alfred Dewayne Brown insisted he had been at his girlfriend's home at the time of the crime. After seeing news of the killings on tele‚Äãvision, he said, he telephoned his girlfriend. Records of the land-line call, though, could not be produced. Last year, however, the missing phone records turned up, and in November, the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the conviction, saying Brown's attorneys were denied access to evidence that could have supported his alibi. Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson now must retry Brown, dismiss the case, or look for some middle ground. The case highlighted the grand jury process, including who is chosen for duty, and the tactics used on witnesses who go before the jurors.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1770,96.64,62.82,25.66,15.2,20.82,26.95,76.5,50.4,39.77,4.46,2.77,0.23,0.11,0,1.3,0.68,1.69,14.01,8.98,4.86,14.92,4.46,1.98,5.14,0.23,9.21,5.31,4.35,6.95,1.69,0.79,4.58,5.88,0.11,5.59,0.79,1.36,0.73,0.9,0,2.03,0,4.18,1.81,2.26,1.24,0.28,0.85,0.06,0.56,0.11,0,11.58,5.08,0.56,0.11,1.3,0.68,1.69,6.21,0.68,0.11,0.68,1.36,4.01,3.39,0.45,0.17,3.95,0.23,0.9,2.2,0.68,0.06,2.71,0.4,0.11,0.11,0.06,0,0.56,0.11,1.19,0.23,0,0.28,0,0.06,0,0.11,0.34,0.45,2.26,10.4,0.45,1.98,7.06,0.62,0.51,0.11,4.46,6.05,0.96,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,17.01,5.65,7.68,0.06,0,1.13,2.49,0,0.4,0,0.34,0.17,0.11,3.73,3.53,3.02,3.26,2.78,-4.34,-3.29,-2.05,-2.8,-3.41,0.23,0.73,0.28,0.68,0.85,0.06,0.62,0,0.62,0.06,0.11,0,0.85,0.11,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,0,0.06,1.7,1.41,16.1,141.24,0.9,248.59,-0.62,101.69,0.4,152.54,1.19,101.69,-0.9,231.64,0.62,451.98,0,141.24,-0.11,11.3,0.11,0,0,73.45,163.84,107.34,101.69,45.2,73.45,0.11,107.34,39.55,22.6,16.95,0,0,0,56.5,62.15,73.45,33.9,5.65,11.3,1.64,1,0.06,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.11,0.06,0,1
12/31/14,8,A,"HOUSTON 2014: THE YEAR IN REVIEW - POLITICS, IMMIGRATION HERALD BIG CHANGES - Election drama, tragic losses and tears of joy all played out as oil prices plummeted ","Amid the daily rumble of a great city, the news can swing from quiet lows to crashing crescendos.
This year brought us November's raucous election, outbursts surrounding the city's controversial equal rights amendment, rising indignation over potentially violent sex offenders being housed in a residential neighborhood, and an ominous sucking sound as the price of crude oil plunged precipitously, probably taking with it a quarter-million jobs from Texas and other oil-producing states.
There was the sound of silence, of mourning, too, as six Spring residents and four Cypress residents were slain in their homes and four workers of a LaPorte chemical plant were fatally overcome by an escaping cloud of toxic gas.
The news struck notes of surprise as a top Texas criminal courts judge announced that he opposes the death penalty, and brought peals of joy as wedding bells rang for Mayor Annise Parker and her life partner of more than 20 years.
These are the stories that brought Houston to great highs and lows in 2014: Houston Equal Rights Ordinance
As contention reached a fever pitch, the Houston City Council in May voted 11-6 to extend equal rights protections to gay and transgender residents. The measure, supported by Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city, was greeted with applause from supporters who packed the chamber. Opponents responded with a petition drive calling for a referendum on the ordinance, which duplicates federal laws banning discrimination based on sex, race, age, disability and other factors. When city officials ruled thousands of petition signatures invalid, ordinance foes sued. A trial is set for January.
Stay family killings
Six members of a Spring family, including four children, were slain in an execution-style shooting in July when, authorities allege, a former member of their extended family came searching for his ex-wife, who was not in the home. Killed were Stephen Stay, 39; his wife, Katie, 34; and their children, Bryan, 13; Emily, 9, Rebecca, 7; and Zach, 4. Another child, Cassidy, 15, suffered a minor head wound. Authorities said Ron Haskell, 33, disguised as a FedEx delivery man, forced his way into the home, tied up family members, then shot them. He has been charged with capital murder.
Cypress family slain
A quiet neighborhood in suburban Cypress was rocked in January when the bodies of Maoye Sun, 50; his wife, Mei Xie, 49; and their sons, Timothy, 9; and Xiao, 7; were found shot to death in their home. The bodies were discovered when Sun, an employee of a Houston oil field equipment maker, failed to appear at work. Each of the victims, whose bodies were found in separate parts of the house, was shot in the head. No arrests have been made.
GOP juggernaut
Texas continued its love affair with the Republican Party in November when former Attorney General Greg Abbott led the GOP juggernaut by defeating former Fort Worth Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis with 59 percent of the vote. Fueled by anti-Obama sentiment, the trend continued with Houston state Sen. Dan Patrick's victorious campaign for lieutenant governor. He won 58 percent of the votes over San Antonio state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte. Republicans also claimed attorney general, land commissioner, comptroller and other top statewide positions. Election 2014 marked the first time in 24 years that an incumbent governor did not seek re-election.
Astrodome redux
Once the ""Eighth Wonder of the World,"" Houston's fabled Astro‚Äãdome got an influential endorsement for redevelopment in December from the Urban Land Institute, which argued the stadium should be converted into an indoor park with lawns, gardens, a promenade of oak trees and exhibit space for festivals and community events. The Dome's future has been in question since 2013 when voters defeated a proposed $217 bond issue for its redevelopment. County Judge Ed Emmett said the proposal from the urban planners, economics and designers,has ""almost a 100 percent chance"" of succeeding.
DuPont deaths
Four workers at DuPont's 800-acre plant in La Porte died in November when a faulty valve released a toxic chemical used to make insecticides. Killed when methyl mercaptan escaped from the containment vessel were Crystle Wise, 53; Wade Baker, 60; and Gilbert Tisnado, 48, and his brother, Robert Tisnado, 39. The younger Tisnado and Baker rushed into the gas-filled area without gas masks after they heard a woman's cry for help. When radio contact with them was lost, Gilbert Tisnado donned a gas mask and also entered the deadly area. Finding his brother overcome by the fumes, he removed his gas mask to render aid and also perished.
Roilings In oil
Soaring U.S. oil output, spurred by hydraulic fracturing and a refusal by OPEC to curb production, created a fuel glut that had producers scrambling to cut costs and employees. Oil futures plunged 46 percent in 2014, with Brent Crude for February delivery dropping to $58.36 a barrel on Monday. Analysts say the bearish turn in the oil business likely will persist through the first half of 2015. Texas and seven other oil-producing states could lose up to 250,000 jobs in that period. The glut, however, has put a smile on the face of American motorists, though, with the cost of regular gasoline at its lowest point since 2008.

12/14/14,8,A,Houston's mayoral race is drawing a crowd ,"
Who's in the running
A look at those who'll definitely be in the race, those who are likely and other possibilities. Page A15
The race to succeed Mayor Annise Parker is shaping up to be Houston's most crowded in decades, with a half-dozen candidates already having declared they will run and another half-dozen possibly joining them.
The campaign for Houston's top job will only begin with velocity on Feb. 1, but candidates for months have quietly met with key donors, activists and interest groups in search of the unbeatable coalition that would deliver a victory in 12 months' time. Top-level strategists have been hired, lawsuits have been filed, and now more than ever, the candidates' names are becoming known.
Most observers consider Rep. Sylvester Turner, with his support base from the African-American population that could cast a third of next year's vote, to be the man to beat in November. Yet his fortunes to win in a December runoff - all but guaranteed to be needed in a large field - depend heavily on whom he faces in a one-on-one comparison.
Councilmen Oliver Pennington and Stephen Costello have committed to the race, with Pennington going as far as to send mailers to potential supporters in July, 18 months before the first votes are to be cast. Ben Hall, who lost to Parker in 2013, launched radio advertisements last month, and former Kemah mayor and Chronicle columnist Bill King designated a campaign treasurer. Former Democratic congressman Chris Bell also is an all-but-filed entrant.
Six weeks before the campaign fundraising floodgates open, the field is settling save for a potential entrant who looms over much of the discussion in Houston power circles: Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, who has not yet declared his intentions. Legally, Garcia cannot make an affirmative move toward running without being forced to resign his county post, though he has acknowledged the pressure he faces from others.
That pressure, though, is pushing him in both directions. Commissioners Court likely would replace Garcia with a Republican sheriff ahead of the next election cycle.
""You're going to be giving them an early 2016 gift,"" said Democratic Sen. Sylvia Garcia, who had the sheriff at her home this month and expressed concern about a run. ""Nobody wants a Latino mayor more than I do, but it's got to be the right time.""
Likewise, some Democrats also worry that their down-ballot judicial candidates could be hurt in 2016 without Garcia at the top of the county ticket.
'It's our time now'
""I know there are some people in the Hispanic community that don't want to give up the safe bet, but our community - it's our time now,"" said Jacob Monty, an immigration lawyer who is a Republican supporter of Garcia. ""I think he proves that you can be progressive and fiscally conservative.""
Backers of Garcia, the county's highest vote-getter in 2012, assert that he would pose the strongest political challenge to Turner. Analysts note, however, that Latinos, presumably Garcia's base, make up only between 10 and 15 percent of the electorate.
Garcia also will confront the same challenge that tests the political mettle of all candidates - collecting enough checks to compete. ""If he can put the money together, he would definitely be a top-tier candidate because he has significant name identification,"" said Nancy Sims, a political analyst at Pierpont Communications. Sims said Garcia would need to raise at least $2 million to $3 million to broadcast his message.
If Garcia does not enter the race, Councilman Ed Gonzalez, a close friend of Garcia, could look to capture Latinos' support. Other prominent Hispanic leaders look to pass on the race, including Metro chairman and Parker ally Gilbert Garcia and Hispanic Chamber of Commerce head Laura Murillo. Both expressed some signs of interest earlier, but do not appear to be joining the field.
Other alternatives
Garcia's exit also could create political lanes for other Democratic alternatives to Turner, like Bell. Though Bell has not formally committed to the race, he has filed a lawsuit challenging Turner's fundraising strategy and plans to make an official announcement in January.
The other four candidates most seriously weighing bids are: Councilman Jack Christie, an at-large councilman uncertain whether he can raise the money needed to compete; County Treasurer Orlando Sanchez, who like Garcia would have to resign to run for mayor; Sean Roberts, a local attorney; and businessman and political neophyte Marty McVey.
Councilmen Michael Kubosh and C.O. Bradford considered the race earlier this year, but both now say they are unlikely to launch campaigns. And despite floating the idea that he was open to a run, outgoing Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst said this month he had no plans to do so.
Conservatives have not yet coalesced around any of the six non-liberal candidates: Pennington, Costello, Hall, King, Christie or Sanchez.
""Right now, there's no clear conservative choice yet, but people are obviously angling for being it,"" said Paul Bettencourt, the new Republican senator from northwest Harris County.
Parker's political strategists themselves are split, with 2009 campaign manager Adam Harris advising Garcia and others like Grant Martin and Sue Davis, top advisers on Parker's three mayoral races, working for Turner. Parker herself stood in the front row at Turner's birthday celebration this fall, a fundraiser that brought in $400,000 for his unopposed re-election contest and sparked Bell's lawsuit.
Turner has raised money this fall despite the city fundraising blackout until Feb. 1, by officially placing the money in his state legislative account. He plans to transfer much of that money to his mayoral campaign - an end-around that Bell believes violates the law and spirit of the blackout ordinance. A judge will decide whether to temporarily block Turner's plan on Jan. 12.
Turner's office may have allowed him to raise money this fall, but it prevents him from doing so since Saturday, when the state's legislative fundraising blackout period began. When Turner's competitors begin to fill their coffers in February, he will have to rely on the money he is raising now until the legislative blackout period ends in mid-June.
'A powerful position'
Turner's 25 years in the Legislature gives him his own advantages, said Austin lobbyist Bill Miller, as does his political alliance with top Democratic Sen. John Whitmire. Turner will have the power to influence the budget and help deliver in Austin what he will be running on in Houston.
""Most candidates would trade their ability to raise money for the ability to spend $90 billion,"" Miller said. ""That's a powerful TEXT MISSING IN PAPER) position."" Mayoral contenders
A look at the definite, likely and potential candidates to run for Houston mayor next year:
Definites
Sylvester Turner: Seen by many to be the front-runner in the field, the longtime state representative is expected to draw on the support of Houston's African-American voters.
Oliver Pennington: The Republican city councilman began his campaign earlier than all other candidates, sending mailers to potential supporters in July.
Stephen Costello: Costello, an at-large councilman, chairs council's budget committee and likely will run as a moderate.
Ben Hall: Hall lost in 2013 to Annise Parker, but the self-funding attorney has already launched radio advertisements this fall ahead of his next mayoral bid.
Chris Bell: Bell, a former congressman, has filed a lawsuit challenging Turner's fundraising strategies and is likely to announce in January.
Likelies
Bill King: King, a former Chronicle columnist and the former mayor of Kemah, has frequently talked about running for mayor and this year has designated a campaign treasurer, the first step before a run.
Marty McVey: A businessman, McVey has no prior political experience and is not expected to be a top-tier candidate.
Sean Roberts: Roberts, an attorney, challenged Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee in 2010 but received less than 5 percent of the vote.
Potentials
Adrian Garcia: The Harris County sheriff likely would rise quickly to the top of the field if he entered the race, but he would have to resign his job as the county's top cop.
Orlando Sanchez: The county treasurer who lost in the 2003 runoff to Bill White has kept his name in the mix this year, though he would need to resign like Garcia would.

12/11/14,8,Metro,"PAC makes gay, transgender rights - an issue in District 6 c ouncil race ","
A political action committee opposed to gay marriage has jumped into a City Council race, arguing the stakes include religious freedom.
Texas Values Action, a group founded by conservative activist Jonathan Saenz, sent a mailer earlier this week to potential voters in far Northwest Austin's District 6, touting candidate Don Zimmerman. The piece describes Zimmerman as pro-life and against gay marriage, and noted he opposes extending spouse benefits to the same-sex partners of government workers. The flier touts Zimmerman's opposition to a proposed ordinance requiring single-occupancy bathrooms in public places to be gender-neutral.
The flier contrasts those stands with Zimmerman's opponent in the Dec. 16 runoff, Jimmy Flannigan. The flier states Flannigan founded the Austin Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce; does not think abortion should be banned; and thinks same-sex couples should receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples, as the city provides. He also supports the gender-neutral bathroom ordinance, which originated in part to ensure transgender people are more comfortable using public restrooms.
Saenz said Texas Values Action is getting involved as part of a larger effort to curb what he considers overreach on the part of city governments. He noted that in July, his and other conservative groups helped persuade a federal judge to throw out an abortion- related Austin ordinance, which required religiously based pregnancy centers that do not offer abortions to post signs announcing that they do not offer medical care.
""As we see it, more local governments in Texas are being more aggressive in attacking religious freedoms,"" Saenz said. ""This is clearly relevant to the election.""
His mailer was posted on Towleroad, a news outlet focused on gay issues. In response, Stonewall Democrats posted on the site: ""Now that the finish line to the City Council run-off is in sight, it's ‚Äòhere we go again' with inflammatory and divisive rhetoric intended to suggest that LGBTQ people are anti-family. Nothing could be further from the truth. So, wake up Mr. Saenz, you are in Austin and it's 2014.""
Zimmerman has written extensively about his belief that homosexuality is wrong. In a 2006 Republican primary for state representative, Zimmerman appealed to voters on the grounds that he was most active in supporting a state ban on gay marriage. (It passed. He lost.)
Even so, sexuality had gone little-mentioned in this City Council campaign. Flannigan has maintained from the beginning that in his district, sexual orientation and gender issues do not matter and voters are focused on issues such as taxes and traffic. He once said a potential constituent he had known for a while said he did not approve of Flannigan's sexual orientation - but quickly added, ""Can you really fix traffic?"" To which Flannigan said he replied: ""The number one issue facing Austin's gay and lesbian community is... (dramatic pause)... traffic!""",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,465,81.95,59.25,11.89,11.47,17.88,30.75,78.28,56.34,42.58,8.39,4.09,0,0.43,0.43,3.01,0.22,4.3,12.26,7.1,1.29,12.47,6.88,2.8,4.73,1.29,13.12,7.1,3.66,5.16,1.94,0.86,2.15,8.82,0.22,8.6,1.51,1.72,0.86,0.43,0.43,3.44,0,3.87,1.51,2.37,0.65,0.22,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,13.98,7.31,0.65,0.22,1.29,0.43,2.8,7.1,1.08,0,0.43,3.23,3.87,3.87,0,0,1.72,0,0,0.86,0.43,0.65,4.52,1.29,0.22,0,0,0,3.66,0,0,0.43,0,0.43,0,0,0,0.43,0.43,0,1.51,9.03,0.65,1.72,6.45,0.43,0,0,2.37,5.16,4.73,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,19.35,6.24,4.52,0.22,0.22,1.72,6.45,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,4.11,4.05,3.94,3.87,3.33,-4.03,-3.14,-1.34,-2.47,-1.07,0.43,0.86,0.86,0,0,0,0.65,0,0,0,1.29,0.65,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.25,1.13,18.34,107.53,0.65,236.56,-0.22,150.54,1.29,215.05,2.15,21.51,-0.22,172.04,0.65,301.08,0,193.55,0.43,86.02,0.86,64.52,0,64.52,150.54,86.02,107.53,0,43.01,0,107.53,86.02,21.51,172.04,0,0,0,86.02,43.01,172.04,193.55,0,0,0.86,1,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,1.29,0.22,0,1
12/6/14,8,A,Cleveland‚Äôs transgender bathroom proposal ,"Cleveland City Council kicked up a firestorm last month by debating an ordinance in committee that would require that access to bathrooms, showers, locker rooms and dressing rooms be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis regardless of ‚Äúrace, religion, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, ethnic group or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.‚Äù
Whether intended or not, as written, the proposed ordinance effectively requires as a matter of law that both genders be given access to all bathrooms and locker rooms in public accommodations within city limits, except for those at establishments with fewer than four employees, private clubs or religious institutions.
The measure remains under consideration in City Council‚Äôs Workforce and Community Benefits Committee. Is there a balance to be found here?
Christopher Evans, editorial writer, Northeast Ohio Media Group: Ordinance 1446-13 offers the transgender community the right to use public restrooms, showers and locker rooms just like everyone else. I don‚Äôt see the problem here. I think City Council would rather wring its hands and dither over a no-brainer antidiscrimination measure than deal with real issues such as the use of deadly force by city police officers.
Sharon Broussard, editorial writer, Northeast Ohio Media Group: I don‚Äôt have a problem with transgender people using whatever bathroom makes them comfortable, particularly since they may be subject to violence, often from hostile men. But I am not comfortable with a broad, gender-neutral bathroom ordinance that would make it easier for heterosexual men with criminal intent or just kinky habits to gain access to bathrooms used by women and children. And they are out there. How to balance both of these rights is tricky, but I think that Cleveland‚Äôs ordinance is far too broad.
Thomas Suddes, editorial writer: If this hasn‚Äôt proved to be a problem in Columbus, why should it be a problem in Cleveland? Answer: It won‚Äôt be. Public policy should be fact-based, not phobia-based. If the most populous city in Ohio ‚Äî which Columbus is ‚Äî can handle this, then surely Cleveland, which prides itself on its comparative sophistication vis-a-vis downstate Ohio, and which moreover is an international visitors‚Äô center, can handle it, too.
Peter Krouse, editorial writer, Northeast Ohio Media Group: The concerns of the transgender community are legitimate, and there is a balance to be found here, but I‚Äôm not sure where that is. I don‚Äôt think opening up all bathrooms to both sexes is the answer. That would deny people ‚Äî males and females ‚Äî the privacy they deserve and possibly put them in uncomfortable or compromising situations. It could also create a fertile environment for predators to strike.
Kevin O‚ÄôBrien, deputy editorial page editor, The Plain Dealer: Just go by the external appearance of the plumbing the good Lord gave you and keep your ‚Äúexpressions‚Äù to yourself. Leave the seat down in the ladies‚Äô room and up in the men‚Äôs room, lest you tempt these hyperactive social engineers to pass a law about that, too.
Elizabeth Sullivan, opinion director, Northeast Ohio Media Group: It‚Äôs important that transgendered individuals remain safe when doing something as basic as using a public restroom where they can face ‚Äî and have faced ‚Äî hostility and violence. But those dangers won‚Äôt evaporate just because of an ordinance. The obvious answer is to add, wherever possible, some gender-neutral bathrooms and locker rooms to give everyone peace of mind. Cleveland‚Äôs ordinance can‚Äôt require that, given the costs, but it can be stated a little less broadly to assure that the law is not misused.
If any of you ‚Äúreporters‚Äù had a 10-year-old daughter, it would be a different story. You are all freaks. ‚Äî Susan Daniels The first time I see a guy walk in the bathroom my wife or granddaughters are in will be the time someone better call an ambulance. ...

1/26/15,9,B,"Bell throwing his hat in the ring again - Ex-councilman, first official mayoral candidate, plans to tackle infrastructure ","Chris Bell, a former city councilman and one-term Democratic congressman, formally announced his campaign for Houston mayor on Sunday, vowing to modernize how the city fills potholes and fixes sidewalks.
Bell became the first candidate to officially kick off a mayoral run in what is expected to be a wide-open, hotly contested race this year. Bell, 55, acknowledged that the race could get ugly and signaled that he would be ready to return fire as soon as he received it.
""I know my competitors will do their best to try and define me. They might even talk about some of the political races that I have run and lost,"" Bell told a crowd of supporters on a windy, sunny afternoon at Sam Houston Park. ""And that's fair game - because if necessary, I'll talk about races they've run and lost.""
Bell has lost three elections in a row, a record that has been fodder for opponents such as state Rep. Sylvester Turner, who is considered the front-runner but has himself lost two bids for mayor. Bell's punch on Sunday follows an aggressive legal push over the past three months to limit the amount of money that Turner can transfer from his officeholder account to his mayoral account.
Bell has long been animated by good-government causes, but after being unable to win an early victory in district court this month, he told reporters Sunday he may drop his suit if he determines it is a ""distraction.""
Some question whether he has the political base, as an Anglo Democrat, and fundraising ability to advance to a runoff in a heavily splintered field. Candidates likely will need to raise $2 million before November to be competitive.
High name ID
However, Bell has experience working donors and has high name identification in a field in which few others do: An internal Bell poll last week showed Bell and Turner tied, and Bell's campaign believes he has a lot more room to grow. And his top strategist, Bill Hyers, has experience winning tough mayoral races, guiding Bill de Blasio in New York to an upset victory in 2013.
Bell believes that infrastructure is the issue that will persuade Houston voters to cast a ballot for him in November. He promised Sunday to build or improve 200 miles of sidewalks during his first term and to synchronize traffic lights. He also pledged a ""technological revolution"" in the way Houston fixes its roads.
""Our streets are broken and clogged and just about making us crazy,"" Bell said. ""When you have as many potholes as we do, you attack them in an almost military-style approach, drafting a tactical plan and putting together the army you need, temporary or otherwise, to get them filled.""
As mayor, Bell also said he would focus on thwarting minor crime, expanding library services for pre-kindergarten students, and tackling Houston's looming pension and budgetary problems.
""But let me make one thing perfectly clear: We are not going to balance our budget on the backs of the men and women who protect us every day - the police and firefighters,"" he said.
Eight other candidates have signaled they will join Bell in the field to replace term-limited Mayor Annise Parker: Turner; city councilmen Oliver Pennington and Stephen Costello; former Chronicle columnist Bill King; 2013 mayoral runner-up Ben Hall; airline executive Joe Ferreira; businessman Marty McVey; and Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, who has not officially committed to the race.
Money to be raised
Bell told reporters he was excited for the pent-up energy of the long-anticipated race to be released.
""We have a lot of money that needs to be raised,"" he said. ""We have a lot of support that needs to be built.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,617,68.48,80.14,13.31,20.23,24.68,22.37,80.23,60.62,47.33,10.86,7.78,1.13,1.3,0.49,3.4,0.97,3.08,13.45,6.65,2.11,11.99,7.94,2.43,7.29,0.32,15.24,6.48,4.7,7.46,1.94,2.59,3.57,8.27,0.16,8.1,1.62,0.97,1.62,1.46,0.32,2.76,0,3.73,1.78,1.78,0.81,0.16,0.49,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,14.1,3.73,0.49,0,0.49,0,1.78,9.72,0,0,0.16,3.73,4.05,3.73,0.16,0.16,3.24,0.16,0.16,2.59,0.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0.49,0,0.32,0,0.32,0.32,0,4.21,7.78,0.32,2.11,5.02,0.32,0,0.16,4.38,3.73,3.89,2.59,0,0,0,0,0,16.53,4.05,5.02,0,0,0.97,6.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.95,3.08,2.88,2.94,2.43,-2.61,-0.83,-0.76,-0.77,-1.43,0.65,0.65,0,0.32,0.16,0,0.32,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.2,2.15,19.8,113.45,0.32,243.11,0,291.73,2.43,243.11,2.43,178.28,-1.46,437.6,1.13,502.43,0,226.9,-0.16,16.21,0.16,0,0,32.41,113.45,113.45,16.21,32.41,97.24,0,129.66,81.04,81.04,48.62,32.41,0,0,48.62,0,162.07,0,0,48.62,0.81,1,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Raises $172.9 Million, a First for Houston Performing Arts
Houston, January 19, 2015‚ÄîHouston Grand Opera (HGO) has completed its fundraising campaign by raising an unprecedented $172.9 million, topping its goal of $165 million by December 31, 2014. Inspiring Performance‚ÄîThe Campaign for Houston Grand Opera was the company's first comprehensive fundraising campaign, and the most successful campaign in the history of Houston's performing arts community.
Inspiring Performance was co-chaired by Houston businessmen and HGO board members J. Scott Arnoldy, Chairman, President, and CEO of Triten Corporation and Albert Chao, President and CEO of Westlake Chemical Corporation. ""Thanks to the tremendous generosity of donors from across Houston, the great state of Texas, and beyond,"" said Arnold, ""Houston will have great opera for years to come, and a stronger future as a great American city.""
HGO Managing Director Perryn Leech added, ""We are humbled by the outpouring of support for HGO's mission and vision: to create the blueprint for a 21st century opera company, one that is world-class, affordable, and deeply connected to its community. We have already taken some thrilling steps to meet these goals and are extremely proud to be serving Houston at this new level.""
Noted HGO Artistic and Music Director Patrick Summers, ""An opera company must mature but never get old. HGO must continue to grow and to advance our art form so that more people in our dynamic, fast-growing city can experience the transformative power of opera for decades to come.""
Inspiring Performance's success was driven by the visionary strategic plan adopted by HGO's board of directors, which focused on those three strategic pillars of excellence, relevance, and affordability. Among the projects and priorities the campaign has funded are:
* 30 new main stage productions.
* 17 world premieres, 1 American premiere.
* The NEXUS initiative, which has funded more than 175,000 free or deeply discounted tickets and subscriptions since its inception in 2008.
* Bringing Richard Wagner's epic Ring cycle to Houston for the first time.
* Critically acclaimed performances of Mieczyslaw Weinberg's long-suppressed opera The Passenger in Houston and at New York's Park Avenue Armory as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.
* The world's first mariachi opera, Cruzar la Cara de la Luna/To Cross the Face of the Moon. * Artistic growth of the HGO Orchestra and Chorus.
* Increased investment in outstanding young operatic talent through the HGO Studio, whose alumni (such as Anna Mar√≠a Mart√≠nez, Joyce DiDonato, and many others) are building major careers around the world.

In response to ""Bill would let officials avoid gay marriage"" (Feb. 25):
Uphold the law or find another job
A bill to allow public servants to avoid performing same-sex marriages? Really?
What about firefighters who don't want to put out fires at same-sex couples' homes, police officers who don't want to respond to crimes at same-sex couples' homes, or teachers who don't want to teach children of same-sex marriages?
Public servants must uphold the law. Our law guarantees separation of church and state. If public servants don't like it, they need to find a different job in the private sector.

In response to ""Group fights LGBT bathroom issue"" (Feb. 25):
It's about common sense; vote no on bathroom ordinance
I urge the mayor and Charlotte City Council to vote no on the ""bathroom bill.""
This is not about being politically correct. It is a moral issue, and a common sense issue.
I urge city officials to stand on the side of common sense and defeat this proposed ordinance. Ray Holt

Vote yes to ensure safety of city's socially disadvantaged
The writer is associate rector at St. Peter's Episcopal Church.
As an Episcopal priest, I am continually moved by Jesus' example of hospitality and kindness toward those in his culture who were shunned and socially disadvantaged, e.g. prostitutes, ethnic minorities, and even people who exercised oppressive political power like centurions.
This ordinance aligns with the compassionate spirit of Jesus.
I support it because it is an important statement of the City's commitment to ensuring the safety of its citizens and to eliminating barriers that prohibit citizens from contributing to the common good.

In response to ""Defying GOP, Obama vetoes Keystone XL pipeline bill"" (Feb. 25):
I'm OK with Keystone veto; let pipeline process play out
This is about bypassing and circumventing prudent review processes.
I don't think that obviating rules to rush profits on a stable resource is a good idea, and I like the beach, fish and shrimp.
Nebraska probably feels the same way about their aquifer, cows and amber waves of grain.
For some reason, they don't like foreigners condemning their private land for profit, and want due process.
I think I like Nebraska, surf 'n turf, and roasted corn on the cob. No rush...

In response to ""Can't fault UNC Board for trying to balance the scales"" (Feb. 22 Forum):
Conservatively inclined professors may appear liberal
The writer is a retired history professor.
Forum writer Thomas Cochran Sr. finds fault with pervasive liberalism at universities.
I would just like to say this: The only way to make universities less liberal is to compromise the integrity of genuine education.
Education means opening minds, not defending a priori positions.
It is obvious that professors who pursue true education are open to a broad spectrum of opinions, which makes them appear ""liberal,"" even if they are conservatively inclined.

2/18/15,10,B,LETTERS - Confederate Heroes Day ,"Justified honor
Regarding ""Hooray for love"" (Page B7, Saturday), what an odd pronouncement, ""The Civil War was about hate.""
Can we simplify all war and say it was about hate?
Was the American Revolution about hate? I thought it was about independence from England.
Was World War II about hate? I thought it was about Hitler invading Europe and the Japanese attacking Pearl Harbor.
What about the Texas War with Mexico? Was it about hate? I thought it was because Mexico violated its agreement with Texian settlers and Santa Anna, self-styled Napoleon of West, was set on war for his own aggrandizement and profit.
Was the War Between the States about hate? The South was fighting for independence from the North. The brave men of the South risked their lives for freedom.
Texas Confederate Heroes Day is just that; it is to honor our Confederate heroes. It is not to honor the Yankees. Let the Yankees have all the holidays they want, but don't try to take away our Confederate Heroes Day. Barbara Duvall Wesolek, Houston
Name change OK
I do not have a problem with changing the name of Confederate Heroes Day. I do, however, object to the statement declaring the Civil War was about hate. Slavery has always been wrong, we know that.

Regarding ""Cancer doc planning drive to cut drug costs"" (Page B1, Tuesday), Dr. Hagop Kantarjian should be applauded for his efforts to highlight the high price of cancer drugs worldwide and particularly here in the U.S. Health care in America is a highly profitable and powerful business. The fact that Congress has enacted legislation to prevent the federal government from negotiating drug prices for the Medicare program shows how much power the lobbyists have over Americans' daily lives.
In addition, cancer patients in the U.S. pay twice as much for drugs as patients in other countries. This is shameful, but Congress fails to act.
The U.S. can and should learn from the experience of other countries in dealing with the drug companies. Leverage America's purchasing power and negotiate with the drug companies in the same way that the Canadians and Europeans do.

As we try to understand the reasons behind this senseless slaughter, we should remember to treat everyone by their deeds, and call an ""act of terrorism"" an act of terrorism - irrespective of the religious affiliations of the perpetrator.

Regarding ""Chicago team stripped of 2014 U.S. title"" (Page C5, Thursday), it is pretty obvious that there was some deception going on with regard to the makeup of the Chicago roster. Therefore, I would like to respond to those wondering out loud about this being about race versus boundaries.
The adults in charge of the Chicago Little League team cheated. I do not think that cheating is a race issue, but I think it is definitely a character issue. I choose to judge these adults on the basis of their character, as evidenced by their behavior.
Sadly the Chicago team members lost something they could have treasured the rest of their lives. Mike Ganis, Houston
Trouble in Spring
Regarding ""TEA to review Spring ISD probe"" (Page A1, Saturday), while school officials at Spring Independent School District have clearly fallen down on the job, students and their parents also bear some responsibility for this mess. Surely a parent who checks his child's report card should know that a failing grade in a class means that class must be repeated. And what thinking student or parent could believe that one receives credit for taking the same class more than once?
This is what happens when parents abdicate the responsibility for their child's education to a school system - be it public or private. Texas graduation requirements, easily found with a simple Internet search, appear in an easy-to-understand two-page document. It's time for Texas parents to ""trust but verify"" when it comes to their children's education.
Aletha Evert, Houston Equal rights ordinance. Regarding ""Both sides confident after mixed verdict"" (Page A1, Saturday), I find it a sad commentary on our city's administration that a personal agenda is driving decision-making by those who are supposed to be representatives of the citizens at large.
Regardless of one's personal opinion of the equal rights ordinance, the only thing that the citizens have been asking is that it be put to the vote of the people.
The petition was not to overturn the ordinance. Whether it is 10,000 or 100,000 signatures should not be the point. A significant number of Houston-ians have spoken.

2/14/15,10,A,Equal Rights Ordinance - Both sides confident after mixed verdict ,"
The city claimed victory Friday when the jury in the trial surrounding Houston's equal rights ordinance found that the law's opponents submitted a repeal referendum petition that contained forgery and other flaws.
However, it issued a series of decisions that was far from a clean sweep for either side.
The ruling is not final, and a judge now will consider the jury's findings about the work of more than 100 circulators of the petition that the city rejected last summer, citing overwhelming notary and signature-gatherer errors.
District Judge Robert Schaffer was not present for Friday's ruling after nearly six days of jury deliberation. Attorneys on both sides said he now will begin counting which signatures are valid to see if opponents have reached the needed 17,269-signature threshold. Schaffer retains wide legal discretion in what he deems valid.
The jury's ruling Friday will trigger a series of legal dominoes that, eventually, will yield a definitive answer: The judge will count the signatures, issue a decision on whether the petition is valid and then the case almost certainly will go to the appellate courts.
Attorneys on both sides, however, were quick to say the jury's verdict would prompt Schaffer to rule in their favor.
""Anyone who was hoping that the jury's verdict would give a clear indication that the Houston equal rights ordinance is valid and will withstand this attack should be thrilled and dancing in their kitchen because that's what the jury did here,"" attorney Geoffrey Harrison said. ""The jury rejected out of hand the repeal petition from the plaintiffs.""
Harrison contends the group is more than 10,000 signatures below the threshold. He said the jury's ruling that 12 of 13 circulators in question submitted pages containing forgery and that some high-volume circulators did not properly sign the pages they collected bodes well for the city. The law's conservative opponents, however, maintained they would prevail when the judge begins his review, saying he has the power to reject some of the jury's findings.
Lawyer Andy Taylor cited the jury's conclusion that none of the 13 circulators in question submitted pages containing fraud as a victory. And on the big-ticket question of whether 98 different circulators correctly ""signed and subscribed"" the pages they submitted, Taylor said he was encouraged by the 33 signature gatherers the jury found had done so.
""The thing that is super significant here is that the jury found no fraud,"" Taylor said. ""This mayor has been claiming for over six months that these hardworking citizens committed fraud, and this jury found that they did not. So they can take that to the bank.""
Parker 'very pleased'
Mayor Annise Parker said in a statement Friday that she was ""very pleased"" with the jury's ruling and expects the judge ultimately will rule that critics' petition had failed. She also said she hopes the opponents will not take the fight to the appellate courts.
""I believe that the majority of Houston wants this divisive fight to be over so that we are able to provide equal rights protections for all of our residents,"" Parker said. ""The city is confident it will prevail.""
The ruling marked yet another twist in the political saga that has unfolded since City Council last spring approved the ordinance with an 11-6 vote. The law bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt.
Critics of the ordinance, largely conservative activists, object to the protections it extends to gay and transgender residents. They sued the city when Parker and former City Attorney David Feldman rejected their petition to force a repeal referendum last summer.
From the outpouring of impassioned testimony in council chambers to, months later, the outcry over the city's admittedly botched subpoenaing of certain pastors, controversy around the law has erupted numerous times.
But the jurors were not contemplating the merits of the ordinance and were instead handed the unenviable task of poring over the 5,199-page petition and answering six questions about the work of more than 100 circulators. Those questions were about technical issues such as whether certain circulators both ""signed and subscribed"" petition pages they collected, whether the city could have determined a specific signature gatherer's identity and whether petition pages contain fraud or forgery. Ten of the 12 jurors signed off on the final decision.
Judge commends jurors
Schaffer and attorneys on both sides marveled at the level of scrutiny jurors applied to the charge, submitting a flurry of detailed questions and, in one instance, calling attention to an improperly redacted page in a sea of thousands of documents.
""The length of this deliberation nobody could have anticipated,"" Schaffer said Thursday.
The deliberations lasted almost as long as the trial, which spanned seven days of testimony and featured everyone from Parker to plaintiff Jared Woodfill to Feldman on the stand.
""It was a very personal trial,"" Woodfill said. ""But I'm excited about the ruling.""
Likewise, Harrison said the city had good reason to celebrate.
""This is an exciting moment and an exciting result for anyone who cares about equal rights in Houston,"" Harrison said.
Both parties will get a better sense of whether their claims to victory are likely to hold up when Schaffer meets with the attorneys on Feb. 19 to discuss what happens next.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,926,83.58,33.34,38.58,51.87,22.59,27.21,79.7,58.32,47.3,7.78,2.81,0.22,0.22,0,0.97,1.19,4.97,17.17,10.69,2.38,11.88,6.48,4.1,6.8,1.08,11.56,4.86,4.43,6.05,0.54,1.51,4.54,11.23,0.54,10.37,2.92,0.86,1.3,2.05,0.32,4.1,0,3.78,2.92,0.86,1.3,1.19,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,11.02,5.83,0.32,0,0.86,1.19,2.38,4,0.11,0,0.32,0.65,1.84,1.62,0.11,0.11,2.7,0.32,0.54,1.51,0.22,0.32,0.76,0.11,0,0,0,0,0.43,0.11,0,0.11,0.32,0.76,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,2.48,7.13,0.54,1.3,5.94,0.43,0,0.11,4.32,4.1,3.13,1.84,0,0,0,0,0,15.23,4.43,5.18,0,0,2.05,3.56,0,0.22,0.11,0,0,0.11,2.95,3.45,2.86,3.3,2.5,-3.36,-2.04,-0.55,-0.95,-1.61,0.54,0.22,0.11,0.32,1.3,0.54,0.22,0,1.4,0,0.32,0.11,1.94,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,1.03,14.85,54,0.32,259.18,-0.22,129.59,1.08,334.77,3.24,107.99,-0.43,248.38,0.97,313.17,0,54,0.22,21.6,0.22,21.6,0,10.8,140.39,54,21.6,0,75.59,0.11,54,75.59,10.8,21.6,21.6,0.22,0,64.79,86.39,43.2,21.6,10.8,0,0.22,1,0.11,0.32,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0.11,0.11,0.11,0,1

Melanie Pang says she doesn't have much time to volunteer.
""I don't always have the privilege because I'm so busy trying to pay off my student debt and support myself and my family,"" she says. Pang lives with her partner, Kendall Cande Toarmina, and their two rescue dogs near the Texas Medical Center.
Pang has instead turned her life mission into her work.
""I definitely got the feeling that I was supposed to be using my voice. I grew up with a lot of limitations,"" she says. ""Through school, I started to see that a lot of those limitations just don't really exist.""
Pang, 28, uses her skills to ""create equal access to opportunity for all people."" She's a training director at First Person, a consulting firm that provides strategy and leadership for socially responsible organizations Among Pang's projects are CAN DO Houston (Children and Neighbors Defeat Obesity), where she serves as project manager.
""I took this job to try to change the way nonprofits work,"" Pang says. ""I would love to see a social enterprise model that would help create economic opportunities for those people who are on the verge of homelessness or experiencing homelessness. We could actually be employing those people, giving them those soft skills, giving them the guidance.
""That's one of my pie-in-the-sky dreams.""
Pang grew up in Missouri City as the youngest of four children to a Chinese father and Filipino mother (who she calls ""a huge inspiration""). She attended Elkins High School and earned a full music-education scholarship to the University of Houston. But something just didn't feel right.
""I started to get this urge, this itch to do more. I was in a wonderful program, but being in music can sometimes be limiting. I felt like college was all about expanding my world view, not narrowing it,"" Pang says.
She gave up her scholarship, got a job and switched to journalism. The new major required an internship, and she found one in the communications department at the Houston Food Bank. That's when her life finally - and fully - clicked into place.
""After hearing all of their stories, I was like, 'I can't just write about this. I have to do something about it.',"" she says.
Pang earned her bachelor's degree in journalism in 2010. She was one of the first students to minor in GLBT studies and served as president of GLOBAL, the school's gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, questioning, inter-sex and asexual alliance. She went on to a master's degree in social work.
She lectured at the university during the 2012-2013 year as part of the GLBT studies course and the Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies Program. She also worked as a community case manager for Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston as part of St. Jerome's Unaccompanied Refuge Minor Foster Care Program.
""I had that sort of Miss America mentality. 'I just want to help people,' "" Pang says. ""I thought going to school was going to help me find my niche. At the end of school, I felt like I had even more options. But I thought, 'Why do I have to choose only one passion?' ""
Pang recently was named social worker of the year by the local chapter of the National Association of Social Workers and was featured in OutSmart magazine's list of emerging LGBTQ women leaders.
She's also a tireless advocate for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, family, marital or military status.
""It's still shocking to so many people (that) LGBT people are currently not protected,"" Pang says. ""Here is our shining opportunity to do something about that.""
Though her days of practicing the French horn and dreams of becoming a music teacher are distant memories, Pang still finds a connection to her advocacy work.
""In band and in music (classes), there was so much about harmony and unity and modesty. I think music is a great model for leadership in teaching people how to work toward a single purpose,"" she says.
""My little oompah-oompah part in the march is not super-important and should not take over everything. It's more about, how I can bring them into the room and how I can elevate their voices? That's not so different from music.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,754,65.96,37.02,23.06,31.14,16.04,22.81,89.12,64.06,51.06,12.6,9.02,4.38,0.27,0,3.32,0.8,3.58,14.19,6.1,1.72,14.85,6.9,5.57,5.7,1.33,15.52,5.44,5.17,7.03,1.86,2.79,2.39,11.54,0.53,11.01,2.65,1.86,1.99,1.86,0.66,3.32,0.13,4.24,2.39,1.59,0.66,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,13.66,4.24,1.59,0,0.13,0,1.72,8.22,0.4,0,3.85,0.27,0.93,0.27,0.66,0,9.68,0.66,0.27,7.82,1.06,0.27,1.99,0.53,0.13,0,0,0,1.19,0.27,0,0.66,0.13,0.93,0.53,0.27,0,0.93,0.13,0.53,5.57,10.61,0,0.8,5.97,0.66,0.93,2.39,2.25,3.85,5.04,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,23.47,6.37,6.76,0.27,0,3.45,6.63,0,1.19,0,0.27,0,0.13,3.42,3.26,3.01,2.76,2.68,-0.82,0.04,1.38,-0.35,0.46,0.4,0.8,1.06,0,0.66,0.13,0.66,0,1.06,0,0.53,0.27,0.53,0,0.66,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.13,0,0,0.4,2.49,1.93,21.17,251.99,1.72,318.3,0.27,318.3,2.79,318.3,2.52,92.84,-0.66,238.73,0.66,450.93,0,39.79,0,53.05,0.53,26.53,0,92.84,92.84,318.3,79.58,13.26,92.84,0.13,79.58,145.89,13.26,106.1,26.53,0.27,0,39.79,0,145.89,53.05,0,26.53,0.13,1,0.13,0.66,0,0,0,0,0.13,0,0.13,0.13,0.13,0,1

Senate OKs sermon protections
Voting 30-1, the Texas Senate on Tuesday approved legislation to protect ministers and religious leaders from being compelled to provide the government copies of their sermons.
Senate Bill 2048 by Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, also exempts religious leaders from having to testify about a sermon in lawsuits to which the government is a party.
The legislation was inspired by the city of Houston's 2014 subpoenas to five Houston pastors who opposed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which bars businesses from discriminating against gay, lesbian and transgender people.

Senate backs ending DPS diversion
The Texas Senate on Tuesday endorsed ending the diversion of State Highway Fund money to the Department of Public Safety.
The lost money for DPS - which amounted to $812.6 million in 2014-15 - would be replaced with money from the state's general fund. The move also would require voters to approve a constitutional amendment striking language allowing highway money to be diverted to DPS.
Senate Bill 139 and Senate Joint Resolution 12 next go to the House, where a proposed constitutional amendment is awaiting a floor vote.

4/28/15,12,A,Transgender supporters take concerns to Austin - Jenner interview raises hopes for families ,"Jenner's interview captured why some genuinely love the Kardashians: HoustonChronicle.com/Jenner
Clutching a picture of her 9-year-old son Benjamin, a tearful Ann Elder said Monday that she had loved and cared for the adopted child for years before she truly got to know him.
""By the age of 3, my little girl started having trouble with wearing female clothing, kept saying that she didn't want to be 'pretty,' that she wanted to be 'handsome,' "" said Elder, a Friendswood native. After three years of doctors' visits and many long talks, Benjamin was diagnosed as ""gender variant,"" she said.
""At 7, my child fully transitioned to a boy, and he is the happiest kid I've ever seen,"" Elder said. ""The day we went to Target to buy him boys' underwear was the day I finally met my child.""
Elder was one of two dozen advocates for transgender Texans who rallied outside the Texas Capitol early Monday, just three days after gold medal decathlon winner Bruce Jenner declared, ""I am a woman"" in an ABC-TV interview with Diane Sawyer.
The Austin gathering came amid battles over the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender people at the state and local levels. Texas lawmakers in this session have filed more than 30 bills that could restrict LGBT rights, while in Houston a conservative activist is continuing to try to force an election that would bar men ""who perceive or express themselves as women"" from entering women's restrooms.
Katrina Stewart, executive director of Transgender Education Network of Texas, said as more transgender Americans like Jenner become more visible, the community experiences both more acceptance - and more backlash.
""We're very hopeful for the Bruce Jenner interview that happened the other day and how that's going to play out in allowing people to better hear, better be of the mindset to listen to the stories of their neighbors and friends,"" said Stewart. ""What we want to do is share our stories. We're not here to make people scared. But that fear shows that they are people listening.""
Members of the transgender community are particularly concerned about a number of House bills that would make it a crime for a transgender person to use a restroom that is contrary to the sex they were assigned at birth.
Rep. Debbie Riddle, R-Tomball, said she filed her so-called ""bathroom bills"" in reaction to Houston Mayor Annise Parker successfully pushing for a local ordinance that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, originally included language that explicitly would have allowed transgender Houstonians to use bathrooms matching their gender expression; the protections remain but the ordinance now puts the burden on the individual to prove he or she was a victim of discrimination.
""That really opens a door for those who really aren't transgender, but who are pedophiles. And it makes it dangerous for little girls; it makes it dangerous for women,"" Riddle said. ""If you don't care about the safety of children then you might support those kinds of things. But if you care about the safety of children more than you care about political correctness, then you would support the bill.""
Rep. Gilbert Pena, R-Pasadena, has filed two bills that would go even further than Riddle's, allowing students to sue and receive $2,000 in relief if they identify a student using a bathroom that doesn't match his or her ""biological sex."" The bills would also require school districts to provide alternative bathroom and locker rooms for transgender students.
 Pena refused to discuss his bills with the Houston Chronicle, but an anti-discrimination activist said his proposal was appalling. ""This is sort of the opposite of small government. This is putting monitors in the bathroom,"" said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. ""It's absolutely immoral to put a bounty on a schoolchild's head.""
Keisling said even or eight other states have recently proposed similar ""bathroom"" bills, but no state has yet passed such legislation. Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, who chairs the State Affairs Committee that determines whether these bills will get a hearing, indicated Monday he does not expect them to go anywhere.
""Those kind of bills require a lot of thought and so I think there's a lot of work that needs to go into related to this,"" Cook said. ""So it would be surprising to me if there was any movement on this issue this late in this session.""
The term ""transgender"" refers to someone whose gender identity or expression does not match the sex he or she was born with. Transgender is unique from ""transsexual,"" in that a transgender person may choose to live as a woman or man - by dressing and identifying themselves as such - without taking hormones or having surgery.
Monday's lobbying effort was successful, the advocates said. Staffers in Pena's office even pledged to meet with LGBT activists after the session to discuss their experiences, said Transgender Education Network of Texas board member Brandon Beck.
Elder, the mother of the transgender son, said she hoped the lobbying further humanized the issue for lawmakers and the public.
""I prayed to God and I said to God I want to be a mother,"" she said. ""My commitment to God is to raise a child in his honor. ... It is my belief that I am still abiding by my commitment to God. This is God's child, and I'm making sure he's going to get the emotional support, the hormonal support, the education, to be everything we all love in our children.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,927,73.42,79.41,12.82,46.28,22.07,24.16,86.3,64.08,49.73,11.97,7.23,1.73,0.76,0.54,2.59,0.97,4.75,15.64,7.55,1.29,13.59,7.01,3.67,5.93,0.86,16.5,4.42,4.1,6.04,2.16,1.4,2.59,12.41,0.43,11.65,1.4,1.73,1.94,2.91,0.76,4.31,0,5.07,3.24,1.51,1.4,0.65,0.43,0.22,0,0.11,0,19.85,7.12,0.76,0,0.65,0.54,2.91,12.73,1.08,0.22,2.59,1.83,1.19,1.19,0,0,5.07,0.11,0.32,3.02,0.97,0.65,3.56,0.54,0.11,0,0,0,0.97,0.22,0,0.32,0.65,0.76,0,0.11,0.22,0.32,0.76,0,4.21,6.15,0.54,1.4,3.78,0.32,0.43,0,3.78,5.07,4.1,1.4,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,19.2,4.96,5.29,0,0,2.7,6.26,0,0.86,0.11,1.19,0.22,0.22,3.58,3.54,3.13,3.12,2.99,-1.51,0.16,0.12,-0.29,-0.52,0.32,1.83,1.94,0.11,0.54,0.22,0.32,0,0.65,0.11,0.54,0.11,0.65,0,0.22,0,0,0.11,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,1.83,1.3,16.61,183.39,1.29,312.84,0.76,140.24,1.29,172.6,1.29,64.72,0,237.32,-0.11,258.9,0,151.02,-0.22,43.15,0.43,10.79,0,53.94,43.15,151.02,151.02,21.57,86.3,0,97.09,140.24,0,21.57,21.57,0.22,0,107.87,0,129.45,248.11,10.79,21.57,0.86,1,0.22,0.43,0.11,0,0,0.22,0.11,0,0.22,0.11,1.62,0.22,1

6/20/15,14,NA,Baseball: Mariners hope to build some momentum vs. Keuchel ,"(SportsNetwork.com) - The Seattle Mariners shoot for back-to-back wins for
just the second time this month as they host the Houston Astros at Safeco
Field in the second of a three-game set on Saturday night.
Seattle has alternated wins and losses over the last eight decisions,
rebounding from a 7-0 shutout versus San Francisco on Thursday by capturing a 5-2 triumph versus the Astros in the series opener. Unfortunately for the Mariners, they are still five games under .500 at home and are the only team
in the AL West that has a negative scoring differential (minus-47) currently.
In snapping a five-game win streak by Houston, the leader in the AL West by 2 1/2 games over Texas, starting pitcher Roenis Elias evened his record at 4-4
by giving up just two runs on four hits, while striking out 10 in his seven
innings of work. Carson Smith eventually came on to grab his fourth save of
the campaign.
On offense, Mark Trumbo finally showed some signs of life by knocking in three of his team's five runs, although he is still hitting just .188. Robinson Cano produced three hits and scored twice, while Nelson Cruz had a pair of hits and
as many walks for the hosts.
""It's an important series. I can't kid you and say it's not,"" commented
Seattle manager Lloyd McClendon. ""It really is. This is important for us to
make a statement and try to continue to move forward and do the things we need to do to get back in this race.""
Lance McCullers was tagged with the loss for Houston as the starter
surrendered five runs -- three earned -- on six hits and three walks over 4  1/3 innings. McCullers, who is now 3-2, struck out six.
The meeting starting promising enough for the Astros as George Springer sent
the very first pitch of the contest into the seats for his 11th home run of
the season, but after that the visitors managed just three hits and one more
run. Marwin Gonzalez had two of those hits, one being his fourth home run.
Prior to last night the Astros were 27-0 on the season when hitting multiple
home runs.
Gunning for his ninth win of the campaign for Houston will be fourth-year man
Dallas Keuchel. The left-hander has alternated wins and losses over his last
five decisions, coming off a victory against Colorado on Monday at home.
In that contest Keuchel gave up three runs on four hits and a pair of walks,
while striking out four in 6 2/3 innings of work. The hurler had a perfect
game working through the first five frames before the Rockies finally broke
through.
In seven previous appearances against Seattle, all but one of those being
starts, Keuchel has a 3-3 mark with a 2.25 ERA.
Over on the other side, Taijuan Walker is hoping his recent efforts will carry
over to tonight, having won two straight and three of his last four outings.
The right-hander went up against the San Francisco Giants on the road Monday
and scattered seven hits, but permitted just a single earned run while fanning
six over seven innings. In the last two games Walker, who is 3-1 in his career
versus Houston, has surrendered only two runs on 15 hits and struck out 12.",Campaign for Houston ,1,556,96.17,54.02,46.41,11.15,23.17,18.71,81.83,60.79,53.42,5.76,3.6,0.18,0.36,0.18,2.16,0.36,2.16,20.86,8.99,11.69,17.99,5.22,3.6,5.22,0.36,10.07,3.78,8.99,5.04,0.72,3.06,1.62,4.86,0.54,4.32,0.36,0.36,0.72,0.18,0.36,2.52,0,5.22,2.16,3.06,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,6.12,1.44,0.36,0,0,0,0.54,4.86,0,0,0,2.7,0.36,0.36,0,0,3.78,0.9,0.9,1.98,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.18,0.72,0,0.18,0,0.9,0.18,0,3.78,11.33,0,3.6,7.37,0.36,0,0.18,6.47,3.24,3.96,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,15.29,5.04,3.96,0,0,0.72,5.58,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,1.67,1.5,1.45,1.5,1.38,-1.34,-0.31,-0.7,0.18,0.09,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0,0,0.18,0.54,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.66,1.31,12.68,71.94,0.18,233.81,0.18,161.87,1.44,161.87,1.62,53.96,-0.54,449.64,-0.9,323.74,0,35.97,0,17.99,0.18,0,0,0,53.96,53.96,35.97,0,107.91,0.18,71.94,17.99,17.99,53.96,0,0,0,17.99,0,53.96,35.97,0,0,0,1,0,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

6/2/15,14,na,What Mumbai can learn from US' equal rights ordinance ,"Mumbai, June 1 -- The silent discrimination that many in Mumbai suffer in public spheres such as employment or housing recently came to light with the story of an MBA graduate being denied a job because of his religion.
A possible solution to this problem could just be in the unlikeliest of places - the metropolis of Houston. One of the most populous cities in the United States, Houston celebrated one year of bringing in a unique law - one that bans all forms of discrimination in all streams of public life.
Called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), the law is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation with a list of 15 categories of possible discrimination. What makes the HERO so progressive is that while it provides protection against religion and race-based discrimination, it also includes two crucial categories - sexual orientation and gender identity.
Spearheading this legislation was one of the few openly gay politicians - Mayor Annise Parker, who was in Mumbai recently to speak to the city's investors about Houston. Speaking to HT, Parker said the ordinance was as much about setting right conventional wrongs as it was about sending out the right signals.
""We didn't have any laws to protect the rights of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender (LGBT) community against discrimination. This ordinance was our way of saying Houston as a city is open and welcoming to everyone, no matter what their personal choices are,"" said Parker.
Now, any act of discrimination is a punishable offence. The law covers a wide range of categories - including race, national origin, marital status and disability. It also covers access to public and private spaces such as restaurants, banks and hotels, among other establishments.
Getting the law passed was not easy. Conservative sections of society were opposed to the bill. What pushed Parker was her own struggle with her identity. ""I began working for gay rights in the '70s, which was quite a repressive time with people getting arrested and stigmatised because of their sexual identity.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,335,92.76,52.53,10.95,16.81,20.94,26.57,83.88,61.49,48.66,7.16,2.69,0.3,0.6,0,0.9,0.6,4.48,17.91,8.66,2.69,16.12,5.67,2.69,5.67,0.9,11.94,7.76,5.07,8.96,1.49,1.49,6.27,8.36,1.19,6.87,0.6,1.19,0.3,1.79,0,2.69,0,2.69,1.19,1.49,0.6,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,12.24,6.57,0,0.3,2.09,0.6,2.09,5.37,0,0,0.9,0.3,2.09,2.09,0,0,3.58,0.6,0.3,2.09,0.6,0.6,2.99,0,0,0,0,0,2.39,0.3,0,0.3,0,0.6,0.6,0,0,0,0.9,0,3.58,7.16,0,1.19,5.37,0.3,0.3,0,2.39,5.67,2.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,14.63,4.78,4.18,0,0,0.9,4.78,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,4.31,4.65,3.55,3.57,3.55,-3.01,-1.38,-0.35,-1.48,-1.72,0,0,0,0.3,2.69,1.79,0.6,0,0.9,0,0.6,0.6,2.39,0.3,0.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.94,1.78,19.16,119.4,0.6,507.46,-0.9,119.4,1.19,208.96,2.09,89.55,-0.9,149.25,0.6,298.51,0,208.96,0.6,59.7,0.6,0,0,0,149.25,29.85,0,0,268.66,-0.3,179.1,149.25,59.7,0,0,0,0,119.4,119.4,149.25,149.25,29.85,0,1.19,1,1.79,1.49,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,1.79,0.9,0.3,0,1
7/30/15,15,B,Mayor pulls back on charter amendments - Changing term limits and revenue cap held in favor of HERO after recent court decision ,"With her signature nondiscrimination law likely to appear on the November ballot, Mayor Annise Parker left in doubt Wednesday whether she will ask City Council to also place before voters long-discussed changes to term limits and the city's revenue cap.
Parker said she has no interest in putting the latter two items to amend the city charter to a vote only to see them fail because they lacked robust campaigns behind them.
""It was my full expectation that I'd be spending my remaining campaign funds and my personal time advocating for these two good- government items, but because of the presence of HERO (the Houston equal rights ordinance) on the ballot, I'm going to be having to split my energy over there,"" she said. ""There is no - at this point - group willing to step up and advocate for the other two. I'm not going to put some things out there just to fail. It may be more timely to bring the charter amendments to next November's electorate, and I can leave that decision to the next mayor.""
Term-limited Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major American city, said she will discuss with council members and make a final decision in the coming days on what items to place on the agenda for the group's Aug. 5 meeting.
The equal rights ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.
Amendments left out
Political observers say the divisive ordinance's appearance on the ballot may skew the electorate by rallying conservatives to show up for what are typically extremely low-turnout municipal elections, and could undercut discussion of other issues in the mayoral and council races, such as the city budget and crumbling streets.
University of Houston political science professor Brandon Rottinghaus said Parker's wariness of moving forward with complicated governance issues when such a clear-cut social issue will be on the ballot is well founded.
""You'll have pro and con on HERO, and that's going to create a politics and a set of voters that may not reflect the kind of voters that would otherwise come out for an issue of importance to city finances,"" he said. ""I think she's wise in that way to push things off to make sure those issues get the kind of hearing they deserve instead of the kind of hearing they'd otherwise get in the politics of the moment.""
Councilman C.O. Bradford took a different view, suggesting the voters drawn out by an open mayoral field and controversial city issues would be those best positioned to decide issues of municipal governance. He called for more charter amendment options, not fewer.
If the mayor does not post an item inviting broad discussion of all council members' ideas, Bradford said, he will seek a special council meeting for that purpose. Among the ideas worthy of discussion, he said, is the ability for council members to place items on the agenda; currently only the mayor has that ability.
""I don't think one single item can lock down the city's business,"" Bradford said, referring to HERO. ""If council is not afforded this opportunity because the mayor doesn't post it, it makes my point again about how the process is broken down here."" Proposals unpopular
The heaviest political lift, the mayor acknowledged, would be to seek an increase in the revenue cap to allow more spending for public safety, as occurred in 2006 under former Mayor Bill White.
The cap, first approved in 2004, limits the annual increase in city property tax revenues to the combined rates of inflation and population growth. Last year, the city hit the cap for the first time, forcing a cut in the tax rate. Houston would have had $53 million more to spend in the current budget without the cap, and confronts a $126 million budget deficit next summer, driven by soaring pension and debt costs, as well as the cap.
Neither City Council nor voters appear inclined to entertain an increase. A council committee in February voted not to send any cap modifications to voters, and an overwhelming share of respondents in a recent KUHF-KHOU poll opposed any tax increase. Still, Parker said she will seek input from the police and fire unions to gauge their willingness to take on a revenue cap campaign.
The other significant change to the charter that Parker had pledged to advance was a shift from three two-year council terms to two four-year terms starting in 2019. That idea has drawn support on the council, but twice as many respondents in the recent poll favored the status quo over the proposed change.
Regardless of what items come up next week, the equal rights ordinance is certain to be debated - under orders from the Texas Supreme Court. The justices on Friday ended months of legal wrangling over whether a repeal petition opponents of the law submitted last year contained enough valid signatures by ruling that the council must repeal the ordinance or place it before the public.
Legal battle continues
Another set of legal wrangling may also result in a petition filed by anti-gay activist and Houston Community College trustee Dave Wilson appearing on the ballot. Wilson seeks a vote to amend the city charter and bar men ""who perceive or express themselves as women"" from entering women's restrooms by defining gender identity the ""innate identification ... assigned at birth."" It would require businesses to adopt the same definition.
The city is in the process of appealing a state district judge's ruling Tuesday that the names on Wilson's petition, which he submitted July 9, must be counted. Parker's legal team has contended his proposal is invalid because it attempts to undercut the equal rights ordinance not via the process set forth for repealing ordinances but by amending the charter.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1024,93.77,31.33,34.46,30.91,25.6,25.49,81.74,59.28,46.88,6.35,3.22,1.07,0,0.1,1.27,0.68,3.13,15.53,9.67,2.15,15.53,5.96,2.44,5.37,1.37,11.82,6.45,4.88,5.66,0.88,0.88,3.91,10.84,0.29,9.96,1.56,1.56,1.46,1.46,0.29,4.3,0,2.15,1.46,0.68,0.29,0.2,0.1,0.1,0,0,0,11.52,4.59,0.29,0,0.39,0.68,1.95,5.08,0.1,0,0.88,0.68,4.49,4.3,0.2,0,4.79,0.1,0.1,2.73,2.05,0.2,0.39,0.1,0,0,0,0,0.39,0,0,0.39,0,0.39,0.2,0.2,0,0.1,0.2,0.2,3.22,9.77,0.68,1.17,6.84,1.07,0.2,0.1,3.71,2.34,2.64,2.15,0,0,0,0,0,14.75,4.2,5.08,0,0,1.95,3.52,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,3.64,3.86,3.42,3.92,3.13,-2.84,-1.65,-0.32,-0.91,-1.16,0.29,0.78,0.2,0,1.17,0.1,0.39,0,0.68,0.1,0.2,0.1,0.98,0.1,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,2.12,1.26,19.58,126.95,0.88,283.2,1.07,175.78,1.76,234.38,2.15,136.72,0,371.09,0.1,371.09,0,195.31,-0.68,39.06,0.39,9.77,0,29.3,146.48,58.59,39.06,107.42,78.13,-0.1,146.48,48.83,19.53,68.36,19.53,0.1,0,126.95,19.53,175.78,9.77,19.53,0,0.39,1,0.1,0.39,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0.1,0.1,0,0.1,1

7/12/15,15,A,"‚ÄòSatan is subtle,‚Äô same-sex marriage foes warn as they prepare to fight court ruling ","
HOUSTON ‚Äî During an evening service titled ‚ÄúStop, Look and Listen‚Äù in the spare fellowship hall of Mount Hebron Missionary Baptist Church, after dire Scripture readings about plagues and last days, the minister rose before a sign that proclaimed, ‚ÄúJesus saves!‚Äù
‚ÄúI wanted to come by today to keep encouraging you to hold on,‚Äù the Rev. Max A. Miller Jr. told the three dozen in attendance. ‚ÄúStand up for what is right.‚Äù
Miller didn‚Äôt directly mention the Supreme Court ruling five days earlier that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, but the inference was inescapable ‚Äî hold on as Christianity comes under attack and fight to preserve our values. Hold on.
In Miller‚Äôs nearby study, several church members gathered after the service to share their unease with the ruling, as a gospel choir practiced within earshot.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply disturbed by the decision the Supreme Court made. It‚Äôs painful as a Christian to see the leadership ‚Äî our president ‚Äî has not taken God into consideration,‚Äù said Daryl Fisher, 54, a firewood salesman who clutched a Bible in one hand as he spoke.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an abomination,‚Äù he said as the others nodded. ‚ÄúChristians will have to stand up and fight even harder for what‚Äôs right. The courts have not respected us.‚Äù
It‚Äôs a sentiment expressed by many conservative Christians since the June 26 ruling ‚Äî a sense that the rest of the country has lost its way.
As 100 evangelical leaders put it in an open letter after the ruling, ‚ÄúEvangelical churches in America now find themselves in a new moral landscape that calls us to minister in a context growing more hostile to a biblical sexual ethic.‚Äù
The Barna Group, an evangelical polling firm, found that 94 percent of evangelical Christians surveyed opposed the Supreme Court ruling, compared with 66 percent of practicing Christians as a whole.
Fully 86 percent of evangelicals agreed that same-sex marriage ‚Äúwill have negative impact on society,‚Äù compared with 59 percent of practicing Christians.
Along with sadness and dismay, many evangelicals expressed guilt and regret that they did not fight harder against what they believe is a sin.
The Rev. Bill Owens, president of the Memphis-based Coalition of African American Pastors, says conservative ministers are organizing to oppose the ruling, planning protests in the South as they did during the civil rights era.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not over. The Supreme Court has gotten things wrong. It got the Dred Scott decision wrong,‚Äù Owens said, referring the 1857 ruling that propped up slavery.
Miller spoke Tuesday on behalf of about 60 African-American Baptist ministers who vowed at a news conference to stand up against same-sex marriage.
‚ÄúIt may be a right, but it‚Äôs not holy. It may be a right, but it‚Äôs not God‚Äôs word,‚Äù Miller said. ‚ÄúWe stand now joined with a unified voice as watchmen on the wall of history to call for a redirection and recommitment to Christian virtues and Christian morals,‚Äù he added.
In the Houston suburbs, the pastor of the more than 3,700-member Sugar Creek Baptist Church quickly addressed the court‚Äôs ruling, urging the congregation to repent and hold fast to biblical principles.
He let them know on the church website that a Republican state lawmaker who belongs to the church had sponsored legislation to protect pastors from having to marry same-sex couples, and church volunteers had already started organizing to support similar efforts with an email list and separate website.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs our Judeo-Christian values that our country was built and founded upon, our biblical values, that are obviously under attack,‚Äù said Sugar Creek‚Äôs associate pastor, the Rev. Clif Cummings, 58. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a continued eroding taking our nation down a vast, slippery slope.‚Äù
In his majority opinion for the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote that the First Amendment guarantees that religious organizations and people ‚Äúmay continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.‚Äù
That‚Äôs little comfort to some.
Texas‚Äô Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the Pastor Protection Act last month to further guarantee ministers‚Äô right to decide whom they marry, and he and other state leaders have spoken out since the ruling about protecting religious liberties. But, Cummings said, ‚ÄúWith this last decision by the Supreme Court, I‚Äôm not sure we can say anything is concrete anymore.‚Äù
At Mount Hebron and other African-American churches, worshippers said they felt particularly betrayed by President Barack Obama, who cited his Christian faith in opposing same-sex marriages when he first campaigned for president.
But in December 2010, the president said his position was evolving, and he fully endorsed same-sex marriage six months before the 2012 general election.
Fisher, the firewood salesman, noted that he had voted for Obama.
‚ÄúAsk me if I regret it,‚Äù said Fisher, still holding his Bible. ‚ÄúI do. If I could take it back, I would ‚Äî on this issue alone. We expect him to rule this nation based on the beliefs in this book.‚Äù
The others in the pastor‚Äôs study agreed.
They also were upset by the decision to light the White House in rainbow colors after the ruling. That same day, Obama spoke at the funeral for the Rev. Clementa Pinckney, an African-American minister gunned down at a church in Charleston, S.C. Surrounded by African-American clergy, Obama prayed and burst into song ‚Äî all after supporting same-sex marriage.
‚ÄúSinging ‚ÄòAmazing Grace‚Äô after he led the charge ‚Äî what a shame,‚Äù Fisher said. ‚ÄúThe church is under siege; it‚Äôs just coming from different directions.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey have tried to attach this to civil rights,‚Äù said the pastor‚Äôs wife, Rhonda Miller, 52.
‚ÄúNo connection whatsoever,‚Äù Fisher said.
‚ÄúBecause they have a choice,‚Äù she said of gays and lesbians.
They blamed themselves for not standing up sooner, and more forcefully. The Bible told them to love the sinner, hate the sin, but perhaps they had been lax, loving the sinners too much.
‚ÄúSatan is subtle,‚Äù Rhonda Miller said. ‚ÄúYou say, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll go along with that,‚Äô and before you know it, it‚Äôs an abomination.‚Äù Sylvia Sims, 59, the church office administrator, said Christian families had ‚Äúmade allowances‚Äù for relatives who had come out of the closet. They have accepted gay and lesbian politicians, including Houston‚Äôs three-term mayor, Annise Parker. Now Sims sees the ruling as a divine wake-up call.
‚ÄúPresident Obama was wrong. Those people were wrong. But they were wrong because we let them be. We let a gay mayor in. And God said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to show you because you let this in,‚Äô‚Äù Sims said. ‚ÄúGod is sick and tired of us as Christians not standing up for what‚Äôs right.‚Äù
Sims has been a straight-ticket Democratic voter, but said no more. Rhonda Miller agreed.
After the high court‚Äôs ruling, Fisher said he initially vowed never to vote for a Democrat again. Now he wants to be a more discerning voter.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to make us more diligent‚Äù as Christian voters, he said, quizzing politicians before elections because, ‚ÄúWe got to know where you stand.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd not just where you stand on Sunday,‚Äù Sims added.
‚ÄúIf we really look at our values, they‚Äôre more conservative,‚Äù the Rev. Miller said. ‚ÄúDemocrats treat us like a 2 a.m. phone call: They come by late in the election, they do nothing for the neighborhood, they give speeches and they sell us out.‚Äù
Miller noted that during the last year, he had formed an alliance with local conservatives, including several white Republican activist ministers, against a Houston equal rights ordinance.
He rejected the notion that ‚Äúgay is the new black‚Äù and comparisons between gay and civil rights ‚Äî a movement dear to the 57-year- old church, which his uncle founded in a garage.
Miller warned his congregation of 1,230 that the city ordinance, which passed in May 2014, would lead to sanctions against Christians.
Last fall, Mayor Parker subpoenaed his sermons along with those of four other ministers. Miller and several others sued the city, saying the sermons were religious speech protected by the First Amendment, and were never made to turn over the documents.
Miller doesn‚Äôt plan to preach about the Supreme Court ruling anytime soon: That would be giving the justices too much power over his work, he said.
In some ways, the minister said, the ruling and other setbacks make it a thrilling time to be a Christian in America. ‚ÄúYou never have testimony,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have a test.‚Äù",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1389,83.17,75.56,24.96,6.14,15.97,22.97,87.11,60.91,47.66,11.3,6.77,0.72,1.44,0.65,1.87,1.66,4.54,14.69,8.93,1.94,13.89,6.12,2.45,5.4,1.44,14.11,4.68,3.31,10.37,3.96,0.86,5.62,9,0.5,8.42,1.66,1.44,0.79,0.86,0.58,3.38,0,5.18,1.73,3.38,1.44,0.36,1.01,0.07,0.14,0.36,0,17.06,7.56,0.65,0.07,0.86,1.37,3.74,9.72,0.94,0,0.29,2.02,6.41,4.61,1.51,0.29,7.34,0.14,0.29,1.44,0.14,5.33,0.94,0.07,0.07,0,0,0,0.58,0.14,0.07,0.36,0.14,0.58,0.14,0.14,0.22,0,0.72,0,4.61,7.7,0.29,0.86,6.05,0.72,0.22,0.22,4.39,5.62,3.24,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,23.47,6.34,7.49,0,0.07,2.52,7.06,0,0.43,0,0,0.07,0.36,2.62,2.76,2.88,2.91,2.35,-2.67,-1.6,-0.22,-1.04,-1.37,0.94,0.22,0.29,0.36,0.72,0,0.94,0.07,2.02,0,4.18,0.5,1.44,0.07,0.72,0,0,0.14,0.07,0,0.29,0.07,0,0,2.78,2.39,22.11,323.97,2.09,338.37,0,165.59,1.3,201.58,1.87,93.59,-0.94,496.76,2.45,460.76,0,194.38,0.43,345.57,3.46,64.79,0,43.2,136.79,187.19,64.79,0,86.39,0.22,115.19,151.19,28.8,28.8,7.2,0.07,0,57.6,21.6,79.19,43.2,14.4,0,0.43,1,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.07,0,0,0.2,0,0,1
7/9/15,15,A,FRANCESCHI: US same-sex marriage decision avoided the tough questions ,"
George Orwell‚Äôs classic novel 1984 ends when the hero, ‚Äúthe last man‚Äù, Winston, finally succumbs to the dictator‚Äôs torture and abandons his last remaining principle, that two plus two equals four:
‚ÄúHis thoughts wandered again. Almost unconsciously he traced with his finger in the dust on the table: 2+2=5.‚Äù
His will had been shattered, his reality broken. The abolition of truth, in this case mathematical truth, had destroyed freedom and all that remained were party lines. Four equals five, if the party line says so.

Gavan Jennings made the above thought-provoking analogy between Orwell‚Äôs futuristic novel and today‚Äôs marriage battle. For Jennings, the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Obergefell v Hodges settled the same-sex marriage equation with the conclusion of ""man+man=marriage"".
Truly, in the case of James Obergefell et al v. Richard Hodges et al, the US Supreme Court made a historic decision. In this decision, the Supreme Court cemented same-sex marriage in all states across the US. This bold move has evoked mixed reactions from different quarters.
The court had been called upon to determine issues central to the prevalent debates on same-sex couples and their recognition under the law.
The petitioners, fourteen same-sex couples and two men whose same-sex partners are deceased, filed suits in Federal District Courts in their home states, claiming that respondent state officials violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution by denying them the right to marry or to have marriages lawfully performed in another state given full recognition.
The court, through a five-to-four majority decision, held that ‚Äúthe US Constitution‚Äôs Fourteenth Amendment requires a State to license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-State.‚Äù
Justice Kennedy, writing for the court, recounts the centrality of marriage as ‚Äúthe first bond of society‚Äù by reference to sages and philosophers throughout annals of human history.
He concludes that these understandings of marriage were based on a conception of marriage as a ‚Äúunion between two persons of the opposite sex.‚Äù
Later, he expounds on the nature of marriage, to wit: ‚ÄúThe nature of marriage is that, through its enduring bond, two persons together can find other freedoms, such as expression, intimacy, and spirituality. This is true for all persons, whatever their sexual orientation.‚Äù
'NOT A LEGISLATURE'
Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas appended a dissenting opinion in which they lamented the majority decision, which counts as a considerable success for supporters of same-sex marriage. The three judges observed:
‚ÄúFive lawyers [the majority was constituted by five Justices] have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriage as a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much more difficult to accept.‚Äù
Justice Scalia describes the background of each of the nine judges, or Supreme Court Justices, who participated in the decision:
‚ÄúTake, for example, this Court, which consists of only nine men and women, all of them successful lawyers, who studied at Harvard or Yale Law School. Four of the nine are natives of New York City. Eight of them grew up in East and West Coast States. Only one hails from the vast expanse in-between. Not a single Southwesterner or even, to tell the truth, a genuine Westerner (California does not count). Not a single evangelical Christian (a group that comprises about one quarter of Americans), or even a Protestant of any denomination.‚Äù
This argument is further expounded by Chief Justice Roberts, when he says:
‚Äúthis Court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us. Under the Constitution, judges have power to say what the law is, not what it should be. The people who ratified the Constitution authorized courts to exercise neither force nor will but merely judgment.‚Äù
Scalia questions how this bench, which cannot be held to be representative at all, is to decide on matters of fundamental importance to society and to all US states.
The dissenting judges further questioned if ‚Äúthe decision on whether the institution of marriage should be changed to include same- sex couples should rest with the people acting through their elected representatives, or with five lawyers who happen to hold commissions authorizing them to resolve legal disputes according to law.‚Äù
The obvious impression one would get from this decision is: ‚Äúthis is it; the debate on marriage and family is a done deal.‚Äù Was the US Court acting as a court of law or morality?
Justice Antonin Scalia once remarked that ‚ÄúI have noticed increasingly in recent years that judges - not just in my country, but internationally - have taken on this function of being moral arbiters for the world‚Äù and further, ‚ÄúIf judges are routinely providing society‚Äôs definitive answers to moral questions on which there is ample room for debate - rather than merely determining the meaning, when enacted, of democratically adopted texts - then judges will be made politically accountable.‚Äù
WHY WE MARRY
A few weeks ago, I quoted Harvard professor, Michael Sandel. Sandel‚Äôs ideas come in handy once again; he speaks of the need to rediscover the art of democratic debate.
He says that it is pointless to pretend that any truly democratic debate is devoid of certain underlying moral principles, religious convictions and philosophical questions: the more we deny our personal biases, the less sincere the debate becomes and the more we lie to ourselves.
Sandel says that it is simply not possible to hold meaningful democratic debate if we fail to address society‚Äôs underlying conception of what is worthy to be honoured and what the essential purpose of institutions is.
In Obergefell v Hodges, Chief Justice Roberts touched on this matter when he said:
‚Äúthe legal abilities of judges also reflect insight into moral and philosophical issues. It is more sensitive to the fact that judges are unelected and unaccountable, and that the legitimacy of their power depends on confining it to the exercise of legal judgment. It is more attuned to the lessons of history, and what it has meant for the country and Court when Justices have exceeded their proper bounds. And it is less pretentious than to suppose that while people around the world have viewed an institution in a particular way for thousands of years, the present generation and the present Court are the ones chosen to burst the bonds of that history and tradition.‚Äù
In spite of the sober debate that reigned throughout the decision, it seems clear that both sides, proponent and dissenting judges, steered away from the crux of the matter.
The majority based their decision on pragmatic and fashionable grounds, while the dissenting judges disagreed on democratic, historical and traditional grounds.
Both sides failed to heed Sandel‚Äôs advice and delve deeply into the philosophy of marriage: what‚Äôs marriage all about? Why does marriage exist? What defines its substance, elements and attributes?
To answer these questions is a must. Otherwise people, regardless of their opinion and sexual orientation, will suffer. Societies will implode.
Obergefell v Hodges has already triggered deep animosities that could jeopardise the genuine tolerance it was intending to trigger and protect. These tensions were already reaching their peak in Houston, Texas a few months ago.
THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES
The mayor of Houston, Annise Parker, issued the hotly contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO). Under one of the parts of the ordinance, transgender people who are barred access to a restroom (whichever they chose, ladies or gents) would be able to file a discrimination complaint.
The ordinance was hotly contested and more than 50,000 signatures were collected in record time. A group of Christians sued the city.
In response, city attorneys issued subpoenas to local pastors. The city sought ‚Äúall speeches, presentations, or sermons related to HERO, the Petition, Mayor Annise Parker, homosexuality, or gender identity prepared by, delivered by, revised by, or approved by you or in your possession,‚Äù according to the Houston Chronicle.
Later, Parker withdrew the subpoenas. She said: ‚ÄúThe reverends came without political agendas, without hate in their hearts. They simply wanted to express their passionate and very sincere concerns about the subpoenas.‚Äù
Princeton University professor, Peter Singer, the animal rights champion, elicits another aspect of this social tension. Singer argues bizarrely in favour of sodomy and bestiality:
‚ÄúNot so long ago, any form of sexuality not leading to the conception of children was seen as, at best, wanton lust, or worse, a perversion. One by one, the taboos have fallen. But not every taboo has crumbled. Sex with animals is still definitely taboo. Sex with animals may be occasionally mutually satisfying; it does not always involve cruelty...and it ceases to be an offence to our status and dignity as human beings.‚Äù
How far can we push the limits? Have we foreseen the ultimate consequences of our actions? Have we gone wrong, or is humanity in the right path?
When questions are not properly answered, reality checks on us. Tradition, history, majority, custom, convenience and fashion are not final, acceptable answers in such deep, life-changing matters.
Emotions and hatred must be set aside, for if we do not live the way we think we will end up thinking the way we live, no matter how unsound or contradictory it may be.
This is what Arthur Koestler calls the ‚Äúterrible compulsion‚Äù to follow one‚Äôs own internal logic through to its final and terrible consequences, where two plus two could easily equal five.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1639,85.57,57.52,29.75,33.9,21.57,29.04,82.49,61.26,49.3,8.24,3.84,0.18,1.16,0.12,0.79,1.22,4.39,16.72,8.42,2.44,13.79,6.22,3.23,5.86,1.22,11.23,6.41,5.92,8.66,3.11,0.67,5.06,13.18,0.67,12.45,3.42,1.77,1.04,2.38,1.04,4.33,0,4.09,2.5,1.53,0.79,0.06,0.67,0,0.37,0,0,13.36,7.14,0.37,0.12,0.79,2.26,2.01,7.38,1.46,0,0.18,1.1,3.11,2.93,0.18,0,2.26,0.31,0.18,1.28,0.06,0.43,1.22,0.06,0,0.06,0,0,0.79,0,0.06,0.24,0.12,0.43,0.06,0.24,0,0.12,0.24,0.06,2.62,6.59,0.24,0.49,5.55,0.31,0,0.24,3.05,3.9,3.36,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,17.75,4.51,6.41,0.43,0,0.79,5.61,0,0.67,0,0.24,0,0,2.85,3.39,2.98,3.25,2.92,-2.64,-1.11,-0.22,-0.73,-1.24,1.22,0.49,0,0.24,1.65,0.18,0.37,0,0.85,0.24,1.71,0.24,1.28,0.31,0.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.06,2.72,1.46,19.61,170.84,1.1,402.68,0.55,158.63,1.34,237.95,1.95,103.72,-0.79,256.25,1.16,268.46,0,128.13,0.49,42.71,0.43,12.2,0,73.22,164.73,109.82,152.53,12.2,103.72,0.12,115.92,109.82,0,18.3,0,0,0,97.62,140.33,140.33,24.41,24.41,0,0.85,1,0.06,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.06,0,0.06,0,1
8/31/15,16,B,Opposition to HERO will be all over ballot - Fight to repeal controversial measure now poised to extend into other races ,"Read more about this issue at HoustonChronicle.com/equalrights
A flurry of candidates opposed to Houston's anti-discrimination ordinance finalized bids for City Council in the waning hours before last Monday's filing deadline, setting the stage for a multi-race campaign against the controversial ballot measure known as HERO.
With the latecomers, the fight to repeal Houston's equal rights ordinance now is poised to extend into all of the at-large and most of the district council races, in addition to the mayor's race.
At first glance, the lineup harkens back to the ""Straight Slate"" of 1985, when conservative power broker Steven Hotze organized challengers to run against incumbent council members who supported job protections for gays employed by the city.
However, members of the anti-HERO campaign and other prominent conservative activists disputed suggestions of a widely coordinated effort, saying the candidates ended up on the ballot for a variety of reasons.
""We have been approached by candidates who oppose the bathroom ordinance,"" said Jared Woodfill, spokesman for the anti- HERO campaign. ""And we have encouraged people to run who oppose the bathroom ordinance, as have other organizations who have the same goal of defeating the ordinance.""
Though the ordinance headed to voters in November bans discrimination based on a series of classes - including sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status - opponents have focused on its protection of sexual orientation and gender identity.
Specifically, critics say the non-discrimination law would allow male sexual predators dressed in drag to enter women's restrooms.
Of City Council members running for re-election, five oppose the ordinance, which applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting, though not religious institutions. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.
They are joined by at least 11 council hopefuls, many of whom launched their bids before it became clear the ordinance would be on the ballot.
Others, such as pastors Willie Davis and Kendall Baker, as well as former teacher Manny Barrera and Siemens sales executive Carl Jarvis, filed to run on the last day.
Most of the last-minute candidates said they launched their bids for reasons other than the ordinance, listing city finances, infrastructure and incumbents' records among their motivations.
Broader frustrations
Though Davis has been a highly visible part of opponents' campaign against the ordinance, he said his decision to challenge Councilman David Robinson in At-Large 2 was spurred by broader frustrations.
""I'm not running just because of the HERO,"" Davis said. ""I'm running because we have a position in this city, in government, that's been held by an individual who has not - who has definitely not - done his due diligence toward serving all of the community."" Jarvis, one of two challengers to District C Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, a vocal HERO supporter, said he opposes the law because it ""lacks clarity about why we even need it in the first place.""
Nevertheless, Jarvis said his campaign will focus largely on issues such as city finances. He and others said they were not encouraged to run by equal rights ordinance opponents.
Barrera, on the other hand, cited his opposition to HERO as one of his main reasons for seeking a council seat.
""I have been against that ordinance from the very beginning,"" said Barrera, who initially considered running in either At-Large 1 or District J. He said he settled on the latter at the insistence of longtime anti-gay activist Dave Wilson.
Wilson said he urged Barrera to run in District J because Councilman Mike Laster is a strong supporter of the equal rights ordinance and ""does not share our family values.""
""Manny is pro-family and he's pro-life and he's for heterosexual marriage,"" Wilson said. ""You know, Mike Laster doesn't share that view. I think there's going to be a big change in November. I think people are fed up and they're going to turn over council seats.""
Wilson said he did not coordinate with HERO opponents' ballot campaign, however, and likely would end up endorsing a slightly different slate of candidates. Wilson is locked in a legal battle with the city to send a charter amendment to voters that would bar men ""who perceive or express themselves as women"" from entering women's restrooms.
""I'm doing this on my own,"" Wilson said. ""I don't play well with other kids in kindergarten at recess."" '21 questions'
Other Harris County conservative activists acknowledged various degrees of involvement in encouraging prospective anti-HERO council candidates.
Houston Area Pastor Council Director Dave Welch, who is helping to run the anti-HERO campaign's church-based efforts to rally voters against the law, said his group does not ""officially enlist or recruit candidates.""
He added, however, that he did broadly encourage those active in the church to seek office.
""In general, we encourage people to run for office and be politically involved,"" Welch said. ""It's pretty hard to have a good government if you don't have good people in government. (HERO) certainly ... provided an inspiration and motivation for some of the folks in our churches to run.""
Gary Polland, who publishes the newsletter Texas Conservative Review, said some candidates with strong views against the ordinance called him to discuss running. He said his advice was not to run unless they had similar convictions about some of the broader issues facing the city, such as finances and infrastructure. The former Harris County Republican Party chairman said he is ""not a one-note Johnny on the issue.""
""We have a questionnaire we send out and it's 21 questions long,"" Polland said. ""Two of those questions are about HERO - two. I think the ordinance is an overreach, but you can be wrong on HERO and right on everything else and be a good candidate.""
In keeping with that perspective, many council candidates who oppose the non-discrimination law said they principally are concerned with city finances and infrastructure, listing HERO as a secondary issue.
'Off-task notion'
""It's a shame that we're having to spend time and energy with this off-task notion,"" said HCC trustee Sandie Mullins Moger, who is running for the open District G seat. Lawyer Greg Travis, her opponent, agreed.
""We shouldn't be messing with social issues,"" Travis said.
Meanwhile, those campaigning for the ordinance were unconcerned about the influx of candidates opposed to HERO.
""It doesn't really bother me,"" said Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas.
Houston GLBT Political Caucus President Maverick Welsh agreed.
""I think it actually helps our slate,"" Welsh said. ""This isn't 1985.""",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,1091,83.41,62.35,23.87,48.12,20.58,28.23,81.39,56.74,46.1,9.17,6.51,1.01,1.1,0.27,2.02,0.92,2.66,12.74,7.15,1.47,14.85,6.6,3.21,5.32,1.47,12.83,5.04,3.3,8.16,3.02,0.82,4.31,10.36,0.27,10.08,1.83,1.37,0.92,1.37,0.46,5.13,0,5.32,3.48,1.65,1.1,0.46,0.46,0,0.37,0,0,18.7,7.88,1.1,0,1.1,1.19,3.02,9.99,0.27,0,0.37,2.2,4.4,4.03,0.37,0,5.22,0.18,0.09,3.85,0.73,0.55,0.82,0.18,0,0.09,0,0,0.55,0.09,0,0.27,0.09,0,0.27,0,0,0.09,0.55,0.09,3.02,7.7,0.37,2.11,4.67,0.46,0,0.09,2.38,4.77,3.57,0.64,0,0,0,0,0,21.81,5.13,6.69,0,0,2.93,7.06,0,0.27,0,0.09,0,0.09,3.19,3.34,3.43,3.61,2.86,-1.72,-0.05,0.82,0.57,-0.2,0.55,0.37,0.37,0.09,1.01,0.09,0.55,0,0.27,0,0.55,0.18,0.82,0,0.27,0,0,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.18,1.66,1.31,16.45,91.66,0.64,329.97,1.19,201.65,1.83,174.15,1.65,146.65,-0.73,210.82,0.37,412.47,0,119.16,0.46,45.83,0.46,18.33,0,73.33,146.65,45.83,55,36.66,128.32,0.09,128.32,73.33,18.33,9.17,9.17,0.09,0,82.49,36.66,210.82,18.33,0,0,0.37,1,0.46,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.09,0,0,0,1

8/30/15,16,B,LETTERS - Date with a HERO ,"Business threat
Regarding ""Anti-ordinance campaign's scare tactics need to be flushed"" (Page B1, Wednesday) actually, the most important reason to oppose HERO (Houston Equal Rights Ordinance) is that $5,000 fine. That means that city officials can slap a $5,000 penalty on a business with whom they disagree on how they do business. It's not about the stupid restrooms; it's about a $5,000 fine for being politically incorrect.
Houston ought to be a place where businesses want to come and do business, and here is the city threatening them with a $5,000 fine.
David M. Woods, Houston Bogus claims
I know the male lawyers leading the potty-gate crusade against equal rights in Houston do not personally believe HERO's passage will invite costumed sexual predators into women's restrooms.
Here's a news flash for their followers: Sexual assault is illegal, and those intent on such conduct don't require a city ordinance to proceed. This mindless focus on the scatalogical is quite disturbing.
Even worse is the willingness of people who were once victims of these same hateful tactics to partner with the perpetrators. The new commercial sponsored by the anti-HEROs requires little imagination to hear a pro-Jim Crow message about keeping restrooms safe. ""Civil rights leaders"" who now want to pull up the ladder would be wise to follow the path of the late, great Julian Bond. He was consistent in his philosophy and his actions.
Shawna L. Reagin, Houston Nonsense
Lisa Falkenberg is telling it like it is with her column about the bigoted opposition to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance which is on the ballot November 3.
The opposition doesn't like gays, and transgenders are higher on their list of people to rage against. They are trying to scare people by saying transgender men will go to women's restrooms to lurk around for peeks at women using the potty. This is total nonsense, as she pointed out there have never been any such problems in cities with similar ordinances.
Equal rights means equal rights for all. Everyone should seek equal rights for everyone else. We are all equal under constitutional law. No one should be denied equal protection under the law.
Jimmy Dunne, Houston Privacy concern
Fear of assault has nothing to do with it. Our opposition is based solely on the ""gender identity"" issue. I do not want my daughter walking into a women's restroom only to find a man there too, nor do I want my wife or daughter using the women's restroom and a man walks in. He doesn't have to ""assault"" them; just his presence is bad enough. Obviously Mayor Parker and Falkenberg seem to want to keep the argument focused on how stupid we must be to fear physical assault. How about simple invasion of privacy?
Paul Watson, Spring ...
Another tragedy
Regarding ""TV killings part of elaborate plot?"" (Page A1, Thursday), how many more lives will have to be sacrificed to take notice of this social crisis that is looming over our nation? It is an irony that guns are ending up in the hands of troubled individuals who are using them very often to settle personal scores. We need to ask ourselves the questions: what is the statistical ratio of guns justifiably used for personal protection versus guns procured illegally to take innocent lives?
Can we implement a more rigorous system of screening people who apply to buy guns? It is an irony that so many of them already had issues that went unnoticed.
Mila Sengupta, Sugar Land Katrina: a decade later
Regarding ""Obama celebrates New Oleans' progress"" (Page A1, Friday), New Orleans has recovered, in main part, despite government help, not because of it.
The response of FEMA and other government agencies hampered rescue efforts and created an instant bureaucracy for people to navigate before they could get help.
The fact is: New Orleans was a hurricane disaster waiting to happen, and everyone ignored it, refusing to take any actions to ameliorate the effects a direct hit would have.
Certainly, the money from Washington was necessary, but the efforts of the private sector were more effective in getting things done and helping residents immediately.
The main lesson of Katrina isn't that the government will save us, but that we can do it ourselves, with government help.
Bob Gayle, Houston
End-of-life care
Regarding ""Straight talk"" (Page B8, Friday), my two greatest regrets about my care of my late mother was that she did not die at home and that I understood too late the options for end-of-life care she wanted.
She had only some mild dementia but at 97 years old could not be safely left alone and was not able to self-care.
I did not understand her condition enough to know that she should have been using hospice. She ended up in the emergency room and hospital three times in the last few months of her life making her life miserable and doing nothing useful. I thought hospice was for people with terminal cancer.
At a certain point, old age too is terminal, and while you can prolong life a few more months with feeding tubes, etc., Mom didn't want that, and I won't want it for me either.
Hospice was a godsend for her, made her life better, counseled me, and too few people, even health professionals, know their role in end-of-life care for the aged. Jean Kennedy Hunter, Houston Political passions
Regarding ""Message to GOP: Don't mess with citizenship"" (Page B9, Thursday), we have a so-called friend who endorses Donald Trump. He says that Trump is on the right page.
Unfortunately for him he mentioned his opinion at dinner with the others at the table who had grandparents who were immigrants from Mexico and who were never rapists or murderers.

8/30/15,16,B,Bathroom bogeymen - Scare tactics about the HERO ordinance are beneath the dignity of this great city. ,"Texans who grew up in Dallas and San Antonio are probably familiar with the Magic Time Machine, a chain of restaurants known more for their manufactured mayhem than for the quality of their food. They'll likely recall that when they needed to go to the restroom, a waiter took them by the hand and led them through the dining room, all the while shouting ""Potty patrol! Potty patrol!"" Laughter invariably ensued.
If we believed that Jared Woodfill, the former head of the Harris County Republican Party, and his fellow opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Amendment were truly concerned about the likelihood of transgender ogres lurking in public restrooms, as they claim in their over-the-top radio ads, we would suggest that Houston restaurants be required to offer a potty patrol service. Of if that's too gauche for this sophisticated trans city - transnational we mean - may we suggest, a la Paris, Rome and London, the required presence of restroom attendants, individuals paid to spend their working hours in public restrooms, with a saucer near the wash basin where patrons deposit tips.
The fact is, Woodfill and company are not concerned that men dressing up as women are just waiting for HERO to pass - and, we presume, for the annual women's apparel sale at Nordstrom - so they can don skirts, blouses and high heels and assault women and girls in public bathrooms. Their aim is to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits gay and transgendered Houstonians, people whose lives they can't accept. If they can stir up the general public with scare tactics that border on the absurd, then so be it; they will have saved Houstonians from surrendering to the creeping acceptance of what they believe to be a deviant lifestyle. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, and anyone persuaded by their cynical ploy should be too.
The so-called HERO measure on the November ballot is designed to protect people against discrimination in employment, housing and other sectors. HERO protects gay and transgender people but also bans discrimination based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information. It also bans discrimination based on family, marital or military status. Woodfill and friends focus on the bathroom menace because they calculate that it borders on legitimate concerns about sexual predators and thus will spill over.
""Nothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is - and always will be - illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people,"" Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle.
In addition, none of the states and municipalities that have had anti-discrimination ordinances for years reports any evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the Houston opponents are predicting. Minnesota, for example, began prohibiting discrimination against transgender people more than 20 years ago. A Minneapolis police spokesman told Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg that sexual assaults from the 1993 law were ""not even remotely"" a problem, and that a police department inquiry found ""nothing"" in the way of such crimes in the city. Iowa, New Mexico, Maine and Hawaii are among more than a dozen jurisdictions that also report no problems.
Whether Houston needs an anti-discrimination ordinance has been and continues to be a legitimate topic for citizens to debate. We happen to believe it will be good for Houston; others argue that it's superfluous, that protections for some groups already are extended by federal law. Those polar perspectives represent an argument worth having, whereas the bathroom bogeyman claim is beneath the dignity of this great city. We really don't need Woodfill and his anti-HERO pals playing potty patrol for us.",Houston Unites,1,609,75.67,70.55,19.09,20.23,26.48,27.42,81.94,59.11,48.93,9.85,5.09,0,1.31,0,0.33,3.12,4.76,14.12,7.72,0.49,13.79,6.9,3.45,7.39,1.31,11.82,4.6,2.79,6.73,1.97,0.33,4.43,12.97,0.99,11.33,2.13,1.15,1.48,1.97,0.82,3.94,0.16,5.58,2.63,2.63,1.48,0.33,0.82,0.33,0.33,0,0,14.45,5.25,0,0,1.81,0.99,1.97,9.2,0.16,0.33,0.66,0.82,1.48,1.15,0.16,0.16,3.94,0.66,0.49,1.64,0.99,0.16,3.12,0.33,0,0,0,0,0.99,0.66,0,0.82,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.16,0.82,0,2.79,5.91,0.16,0.66,4.93,0.16,0.16,0,3.45,3.12,3.45,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,14.78,3.45,6.24,0,0.33,0.99,3.78,0,0.66,0.33,0.16,0,0.16,3.35,3.41,2.93,2.68,2.75,-2.61,-1.46,-0.57,-1.14,-1.95,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.82,0.99,0.66,0.99,0,0.66,0.16,0.49,0.49,0.99,0.16,0.49,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,2.16,1.37,15.84,114.94,0.16,377.67,-0.49,82.1,0.49,147.78,1.48,65.68,-0.66,197.04,-0.49,410.51,0,65.68,0,82.1,0.82,32.84,0,65.68,131.36,147.78,16.42,32.84,82.1,0.33,164.2,65.68,16.42,0,0,0,0,114.94,32.84,213.46,98.52,16.42,0,1.31,1,0.66,0.99,0,0,0.16,0,0.33,0,0.66,0.33,0.66,0,1
8/29/15,16,b,HERO backers rebut restroom issue in ad ,"Supporters of Houston's equal rights ordinance released their first official radio ad Friday, countering opponents' claim that the law presents a public safety threat and seeking to reframe the debate before voters consider the issue in November.
The ad, airing on seven local stations during the next two weeks, features Servants of Christ United Methodist Church Rev. Will Reed tackling the message that critics of the law released last week in a one-minute radio spot. In the piece, a young woman said the non-discrimination ordinance allows men to enter women's restrooms - which she called ""filthy"" and ""unsafe.""
$100,000 media buy
Critics of the law have long alleged that it would allow male sexual predators dressed in drag to enter womens' restrooms.
""What's being lost is that it's already illegal to go into a bathroom to harm or harass someone,"" Reed says in the ad. ""This law won't change that. We looked into it, and HERO is actually about providing a needed local tool to protect Houstonians from discrimination based on their race, religion, age, gender, military status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability.""
Houston Unites staff said the media buy cost about $100,000 and will air for two weeks on KHMX-FM, KKBQ/KTHT-FM, KODA-FM, KPRC-AM, KTRH-AM, RODA-FM and RTRH-AM.
Both campaigns shifted quickly into gear after the Texas Supreme Court ordered City Council in late July to either repeal the law or affirm it and send the issue to voters, capping a year-long legal battle. City Council voted 12-5 to uphold the law in August, officially placing it on the November ballot.
The ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for critics - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
'Deception' claims
Opponents, who have seized on the law's perceived public safety threat, were quick to dismiss supporters' ad Friday.
Campaign spokesman Jared Woodfill said the message should offer little comfort to residents.
""All the deception and misdirection in the world will never change the fact that this ordinance will allow men to enter women's restrooms,"" Woodfill said.
Kevin Nix, who coordinates media for the Houston Unites campaign, said in a written statement that the ""ad is about setting the record straight on what the equal rights ordinance is.""
""It's about our core values of treating others the way we want to be treated,"" Nix said. ""It's about ending employment and housing discrimination in Houston, given that more than half of the claims when the ordinance was on the books were due to racial discrimination. We will continue setting the record straight, too, because opponents are badly misleading and deceiving voters.""",Houston Unites,1,487,88.65,60.82,29.76,8.67,22.14,25.05,77.62,52.98,40.04,6.57,1.85,0,0.82,0,0.21,0.41,4.72,13.14,8.62,1.64,12.32,5.75,3.08,5.54,0.62,11.5,5.75,3.9,8.83,1.64,0,7.19,7.6,0.41,6.98,0.62,2.05,1.03,1.23,0.21,2.67,0,3.29,1.03,2.26,0.41,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,13.35,7.39,0,0,1.64,0.41,2.67,5.95,0.41,0,1.03,0.82,3.29,2.87,0.41,0,4.11,0,0.62,2.05,0.41,1.23,1.23,0.41,0,0,0,0,1.23,0,0,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,1.44,0,1.85,7.8,0.21,1.44,5.54,0.62,0,0,6.16,3.9,2.67,1.23,0,0,0,0,0,24.02,4.52,9.65,0,0,2.87,6.98,0,0.41,0,0.21,0,0,4.37,4.73,3.97,4.31,3.9,-3.39,-2.29,-0.23,-2.32,-2.22,0,0.41,0.62,0.82,2.26,1.64,0.82,0,0.82,0.21,1.03,0.82,2.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.74,1.88,19.99,123.2,0.41,410.68,-1.23,61.6,0.62,246.41,2.26,123.2,-0.82,246.41,0,472.28,0,61.6,0.21,164.27,1.64,20.53,0,102.67,102.67,0,61.6,61.6,0,0,102.67,205.34,41.07,20.53,20.53,0,20.53,102.67,123.2,102.67,102.67,0,0,1.85,1,0.82,0.62,0,0,0,0.21,0.62,0,0.82,0,0,0.41,1

8/27/15,16,B,Language to appear on HERO ballot approved - City Council signs off a week after wording was ruled incorrect ,"City Council on Wednesday approved the language that will appear on the November ballot for voters to decide the fate of Houston's equal rights ordinance, one week after the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the original wording was incorrect.
Earlier this month, City Council signed off on a ballot item that would have asked voters whether they wanted to repeal the ordinance. Conservative critics sued the city over the wording, saying it was intended to confuse voters that would naturally vote ""no"" on any item pertaining to the law - a vote that would have instead affirmed the ordinance.
After the supreme court's ruling that the city had erred, Mayor Annise Parker's administration came back with new language that instead asks voters if they favor the law. It's a technical issue, but one that both campaigns needed clarity on to craft their messaging and start running ads.
'Provocative' verbage
City Council on Wednesday went even further into the weeds on the ballot language when at-large councilman C.O. Bradford offered an amendment that would have removed from the ballot language enumerating the groups protected under the law, such as pregnant women and veterans. Bradford eventually withdrew the amendment, and City Council unanimously approved the administration's version, but not before touching off some debate.
Bradford said that naming the protected classes ""simply serves as a verbage that's going to be provocative, that's going to simply arouse passion"" on both sides of the issue.
The ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.
City Council passed the ordinance 11-6 in 2014, triggering a yearlong legal battle between opponents and city officials over whether to send the issue to voters. The Texas Supreme Court in late July ordered City Council to either repeal the ordinance or affirm it and place it on the November ballot. By a 12-5 vote earlier this month, City Council opted for the latter.
'Civil' discussion
Parker, who has been vocal about her frustration with the court ruling, said Wednesday's discussion was ""civil.""

8/26/15,16,B,Commentary - Anti-ordinance campaign's scare tactics need to be flushed ,"
A personal question today: How do you feel about public restrooms?
Do you see them as useful facilities whose benefits far outweigh the occasional untidiness?
Or, are you so disgusted by public restrooms that you avoid them at all costs, entering only in the case of an emergency, and then, only with pinched nose and value-sized pump of anti-bacterial lotion?
Your answer may reveal something about your politics, according to Jonathan Haidt, a moral psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business. The more grossed out you are by public restrooms, the more conservative you are likely to be - and vice versa.
This is why bathrooms are the perfect tool for social conservatives trying to defeat Houston's equal rights ordinance. By the looks of the group's website, it might be the only tool.
Critics, organizing under the name ""Campaign for Houston,"" are insinuating that the new ordinance would make conditions even more disgusting - perhaps even dangerous - by allowing men to use women's facilities.
The so-called HERO ordinance, which will appear on the November ballot, really has little to do with potty time. It's about protecting people against discrimination in employment, housing and other sectors. It protects gay and transgender people, but also bans discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. So why are we talking about bathrooms? Because one small aspect of it would let transgender people use the bathroom of their choice.
That means a transgender woman who may wear dresses and makeup can use the women's restroom, rather than turning heads at the urinals. A transgender man who may sport lumberjack attire and a burly beard can use the men's restroom. It's really quite simple. It's about reducing drama, not creating it. As one transgender activist explains in a popular Twitter hashtag, #wejustneedtopee.
This simple accommodation has become the bogeyman's best weapon. Critics suggest it will lead to men dressing up as women to assault women and girls in bathrooms.
For critics such as former Harris County Republican Party chairman Jared Woodfill, the claim is just rough-and-tumble politics. It's a way to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits a group of people whose lifestyle they don't support. The claims might even be comical except for the fact that people believe them.
An ad set to air for two weeks on several local stations - including Mix 96.5, Sunny 99.1, KNTH AM 1070 and the conservative KSEV Radio - attempts to exploit that fear and disgust.
An unidentified woman claims she's afraid to have a baby in Houston because the ordinance lets men use women's restrooms. ""That is filthy, that is disgusting, and that is unsafe,"" the woman says.
She goes on to say she speaks for all moms. Yet, she acknowledges she isn't a mom. She isn't even pregnant. She simply hopes  ""one day"" to have a kid.
No real victims
Sorry, sister. You don't speak for me. I don't find solidarity in your ignorance.
As Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle: ""Nothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is - and always will be - illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people.""
If this ordinance posed a real danger, opponents wouldn't have to find some future parent to feign fear of becoming a victim ""one day."" They could surely find a real victim in one of the other cities that passed anti-discrimination ordinances decades ago.
Last year, the nonprofit, progressive website Media Matters tried to find them. It surveyed more than a dozen jurisdictions with equal rights ordinances, asking officials from states as diverse as Iowa, Hawaii, Maine and New Mexico for any evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the critics in Houston are predicting.
The officials reported none.
For those of you who don't trust Media Matters' research, I contacted several officials myself, and they verified their positions. One of them was John Elder, a Minneapolis police spokesman whose state of Minnesota began prohibiting discrimination against transgender people more than 20 years ago.
Elder said sexual assaults stemming from the 1993 law were ""not even remotely"" a problem, and that a police department inquiry found ""nothing"" in the way of such crimes in the city.
Don't buy into an urban myth
In 1997, the city of Cambridge became one of the first jurisdictions in Massachusetts to amend its human rights ordinance to include gender identity and expression, police spokesman Jeremy Warnick said Tuesday.
He sent me the full testimony of police Superintendent Christopher Burke before the state House in 2011, advocating for a statewide bill for transgender equal rights.
Burke, speaking ""as a member of the law enforcement community, husband, father and citizen,"" testified that the bill would not harm women and children. He said there had been no incidents or issues regarding people abusing the Cambridge ordinance.
Massachusetts passed the law. Houstonians should do the same.
Even if you insist on voting against it, pick another reason. Maybe you don't want to condone a transgender lifestyle. Maybe you believe protections for some groups are already extended by federal law, and you don't want a local ordinance that could offer relief more quickly and less expensively for your fellow Houstonians.
But don't vote against the ordinance because of urban myths about sexual predators in bathrooms. Sexual predators exist. But if they wanted to attack you in a public bathroom, they wouldn't need a city ordinance to do it.",Houston Unites,1,922,74.66,77.18,12.25,7.53,17.07,25.16,84.38,62.15,49.02,9.54,5.53,0.54,0.22,1.84,0.98,1.3,4.01,14.53,8.13,1.84,13.23,7.38,4.34,5.75,2.17,13.67,6.4,4.34,6.62,1.3,0.43,4.99,14.97,1.08,13.23,2.06,1.95,1.84,2.6,1.08,4.01,0,4.45,1.52,2.93,0.65,0.11,0.54,0.33,0,0,0,17.25,5.64,0.22,0.11,0.98,0.54,2.28,11.28,0.98,0,2.17,1.19,2.06,1.74,0.11,0.22,2.6,0.33,0.22,1.74,0.33,0.11,2.17,0.33,0,0,0.11,0,0.76,0,0,0.43,0.43,0,0,0.11,0,0.22,1.19,0.54,3.9,5.64,0,0.76,3.9,0.54,0,0.11,3.25,2.28,4.66,1.41,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,18.44,5.64,5.97,0.43,0,2.82,3.58,0,0.33,0,0.54,0.54,0.11,3.6,3.63,3.16,3.21,2.91,-4,-2.43,-1.16,-2.23,-3,0.11,0.43,0.33,1.19,1.52,0.43,0.76,0,0.98,0.11,0.11,0.87,0.98,0.22,0.76,0,0,0.54,0,0,0.11,0.11,0,0,2.02,1.89,18.11,151.84,0.65,368.76,-0.65,141,0.76,195.23,1.19,97.61,-0.76,216.92,-1.19,357.92,0,119.31,-0.22,86.77,0.87,21.69,0,86.77,130.15,151.84,86.77,43.38,141,0.11,108.46,86.77,10.85,75.92,21.69,-0.22,10.85,108.46,32.54,75.92,141,32.54,0,1.95,1,0.33,0.43,0,0,0.11,0.33,0.33,0,0.33,0.11,0.87,0,1

8/25/15,16,B,HERO critics air radio ad in debate ,"
Opponents of Houston's equal rights ordinance released a one-minute radio spot Monday that targets female voters, hitting the airwaves first in what's expected to be a heated and expensive campaign over the law that will appear on the November ballot.
In the ad, a young woman talks about the perceived threat to public safety the ordinance presents. Critics have long asserted that the broad nondiscrimination law, which includes protections for gay and transgender residents, would allow male sexual predators dressed in drag to enter women's restrooms.
A heated legal battle between opponents seeking to place the law on the ballot and the city ended with a Texas Supreme Court decision in late July ordering City Council to either repeal the law or vote to affirm it and place it on the November ballot. After a 12-5 vote, City Council opted for the latter.
The two-week, $100,000 purchase will air on several radio stations, including Mix 96.5, Sunny 99.1, KNTH AM 1070 and the conservative KSEV Radio.
In the ad, an unidentified woman says that she would like to give birth to a child in Houston but is concerned about the equal rights law.
""There are already federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination against pregnant women, but this ordinance will allow men to freely go into women's bathrooms, locker rooms and showers. That is filthy, that is disgusting and that is unsafe,"" the ad states.
The Houston Unites campaign, supporters of the ordinance, responded to the ad in a written statement Monday dismissing the message. The campaign has yet to make any media buys, but manager Richard Carlbom has said the group will hit the airwaves and TV in the coming months.
""The ad is vulgar and grossly misleading. Nothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is - and always will be - illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people. And the ad leaves out the fact that the law protects tens of thousands of Houstonians from job discrimination based on their race, age, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability,"" the statement said.
Jared Woodfill, a conservative activist, said the opponents' media will continue to focus on the bathroom issue and classes that he said already have sufficient state and federal protections.
Even though election day is still more than two months away, Woodfill said opponents are confident they can sustain a media presence in an expensive market.
""If you cannot afford to stay up on the air, then you wait,"" Woodfill said. ""But we believe we will have the resources to stay up, and I think it's important to define the debate over an ordinance that the mayor has spent a year misrepresenting.""
The ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for critics - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status. The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.

8/23/15,16,B,Defense of faith defines Paxton - Attorney general doesn't shy from using power of office to protect beliefs. ,"
Until overshadowed by charges of felony securities fraud, Ken Paxton's tenure as state attorney general was defined by his passionate defense of religion, particularly on issues important to his fellow conservative Christians.
If there has been a defining principle, a Paxton Doctrine, established in his first 71‚ÅÑ2 months in office, it was forged on same-sex marriage, contraceptives under ""Obamacare,"" Houston's anti-discrimination ordinance and other legal controversies where Paxton rallied the power of his office to protect religious beliefs he says are under assault in America.
""Sadly,"" he told a gathering of religious conservatives in April, ""we live in a time where good, honest people are being vilified across this country for living their lives according to their religious belief.""
As state government's top lawyer, Paxton is comfortable speaking publicly about matters of faith.
He attends the large, influential Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano along with several leading conservative members of the Legislature, is a former board member for a church-run crisis pregnancy center in Richardson that seeks to steer women away from abortion and asked for prayers as the U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay marriage loomed.
After the Supreme Court defied those prayers with a June ruling that tossed out all state bans on gay marriage, Paxton blasted the ruling as ""lawless"" and said he feared it would inspire a backlash against those who follow the teachings of their religion.
He lamented that the marriage debate had devolved into ""personal and economic aggression against people of faith.""
And he blamed progressives and sympathetic media outlets for using the issue to ""mock, deride and intimidate devout individuals.""
Paxton's solution was to assure county clerks that they could decline to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples if they had religious objections to the practice.
Critics said that Paxton gave clerks permission to discriminate along with legally dubious advice, but religious conservatives piled on the praise, including the American Family Association, which sent along a ""Texas-sized thank you"" and expressed the fervent hope that Paxton's example would inspire other states to follow suit.
Creating a legacy
Every attorney general has a legacy.
John Cornyn, now a U.S. senator, promoted open government during his tenure as Texas attorney general from 1999 to 2002.
Greg Abbott, now governor, forged a national reputation as attorney general by repeatedly filing lawsuits to thwart President Barack Obama's policies.
Paxton, a tea party-backed Republican who spent 10 years in the Texas House and two years in the Senate, has continued the practice of suing the Obama administration, particularly on environmental regulations and immigration policies. But his emphasis on protecting religious freedom is a recurring theme, whether in legal briefs, speeches or interviews on conservative talk radio, his preferred medium. Paxton's job as the state's chief lawyer, however, took a sharp turn when Collin County grand jurors issued indictments, unsealed this month, alleging that Paxton violated state securities laws in investment deals he brokered before becoming attorney general.
On Aug. 3, he was arrested, fingerprinted and released on bond. (Two fraud charges were dismissed and replaced with new indictments last week to clarify the charges.)
Paxton, who isn't required to step down while he fights the charges, returned to work as attorney general, a job that has broad authority. In addition to providing legal advice and representation to state officials, his office investigates deceptive trade practices, enforces open-government laws, collects child support and helps local prosecutors with criminal cases. Investigators pursue fraud, election violations, online child predators and parole violations. More than 740 lawyers handle appeals and civil and criminal cases.
It remains to be seen whether the criminal case against Paxton will prove to be a distraction.
But one week after his mugshot was published far and wide, Paxton filed a legal brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to accept a case involving Houston Baptist University, which is attempting to toss out a federal rule requiring religious nonprofits to provide employees with insurance coverage for ""morning after pills"" and related birth control.
""The continued assault on religious liberties in our nation threatens every single American and undermines the foundation of our Constitution,"" Paxton said about the brief. ""No government should impose costly fines on its citizens for living in accordance with their convictions.""
The brief followed a July letter urging Republican leaders in Congress to ensure that religious nonprofits cannot lose their tax- exempt status for acting on their opposition to gay marriage.
Also in July, Paxton praised a Texas Supreme Court ruling that repealed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, calling it a victory for the conservative Christian pastors who opposed the rule that bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as on age, national original, marital status and more.
Religion
as trump card
The legal philosophy embraced by Paxton, who declined to be interviewed for this story, is based on an expansive view of the First Amendment, which says the government may not prohibit the free exercise of religion.
When religious beliefs clash with another constitutional right, such as gay marriage, or with a government rule or policy, religion holds the trump card, Paxton believes.
""Our guiding principle should be to protect people who want to live, work and raise their families in accordance with their religious faith,"" he has said.
Fueled by the same-sex marriage ruling, religious liberty is an emerging theme in Republican politics. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made it a centerpiece of his presidential campaign, courting Iowa's dominant evangelical voters with a rally this month featuring those ""victimized by government persecution.""
But the hard-line position isn't shared by the nation's legal system, which has long struggled with the intersection of religion and law - buffeted by a continuous churn of lawsuits and court rulings that produce ever-shifting legal ground.
Understanding the legal struggle begins with one premise: ""From the beginning, we felt as a nation that religion was special and deserving of something extra,"" said Mark Goldfeder, director of the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University's Law School.
""It's always been an American value to let people live according to the dictates of their conscience,"" Goldfeder said. ""The question is just how far do those accommodations go?"" There are no hard rules, but religious freedom typically reaches its limit at ""the point where it harms another,"" he said. When the courts dismantled racial segregation, for example, religious practice was rejected as an excuse for discrimination based on race.
How far religious accommodations go on same-sex marriage remains to be determined, but Goldfeder sees value in compromise - and the Texas attorney general's office could offer a lesson on how to draw the line, he said.
Despite Paxton's incendiary language on the Supreme Court's decision, his agency found a more temperate middle ground, issuing a more measured legal opinion telling clerks that they could decline to serve same-sex couples only if somebody else was available to provide a marriage license.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1156,91.71,67.89,13.43,18.2,26.88,31.92,82.09,54.67,41.44,7.44,4.07,0,0.43,0.09,1.99,1.04,3.37,13.41,7.44,1.12,14.71,4.33,2.25,5.88,0.52,9.86,7.09,2.85,12.28,2.16,1.21,9.08,8.48,0.52,7.87,2.25,1.04,1.04,1.12,0.17,3.11,0,4.33,2.08,2.25,0.87,0.43,0.35,0.09,0.09,0.09,0,15.05,7.96,0.87,0.09,1.56,1.21,2.6,7.87,1.04,0,0.09,1.99,5.97,5.36,0.52,0.09,7.87,0.09,0.09,4.15,0.78,3.03,1.56,0.43,0,0,0,0,0.78,0.09,0,0.26,0.17,0.35,0,0.09,0,0,1.12,0.26,2.77,6.66,0.26,0.78,5.54,0.26,0,0.17,3.37,3.29,3.11,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,16.61,4.33,6.4,0.09,0,1.47,4.33,0,0.43,0,0.26,0.09,0.26,3.91,4.47,3.83,4.18,3.81,-3.64,-2.13,-0.48,-0.83,-1.53,0.95,0.52,0.35,0.52,0.95,0.61,0.52,0,1.73,0.09,3.63,0.09,2.16,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0,0.17,2.28,1.35,21.38,147.06,0.95,389.27,-0.09,138.41,1.21,285.47,2.25,34.6,0,397.92,1.82,320.07,0,173.01,0.52,302.77,3.03,34.6,0,69.2,155.71,129.76,138.41,34.6,43.25,-0.09,103.81,77.85,8.65,43.25,8.65,0.09,0,95.16,34.6,77.85,34.6,17.3,0,0.78,1,0.17,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0.09,0,0.17,0.35,0,0,1

8/20/15,16,A,Court: Redo HERO ballot - Parker's wording overruled in win for law's critics ,"A second Supreme Court decision in less than one month overruling Mayor Annise Parker's administration in connection with her embattled nondiscrimination ordinance found that the mayor and City Council erred in choosing the language that will appear on the November ballot, a key decision that will shape messaging for both campaigns this fall.
Rather than asking residents to support a repeal of the law as the measure was originally worded, the Texas court said in a ruling Wednesday that voters should be asked whether or not they support the ordinance.
Conservative critics of the law strongly objected to Parker's proposed ballot language, saying it was intended to confuse voters opposed to the ordinance who were likely to vote ""no"" on any item pertaining to the law - a vote that would have instead affirmed the law. City Council approved the original ballot language Aug. 5 despite concerns from some council members.
The justices, however, writing in ""yet another mandamus proceeding concerning the city of Houston's equal rights ordinance,"" said the city charter is clear in requiring that voters be asked to vote for or against the ordinance.
""Though the ordinance is controversial, the law governing the City Council's duties is clear. Our decision rests not on our views on the ordinance - a political issue the citizens of Houston must decide - but on the clear dictates of the city charter,"" the justices wrote. ""The City Council must comply with its own laws regarding the handling of a referendum petition and any resulting election.""
The ruling marked the second time the justices have stepped in and ruled against the city in legal matters pertaining to the equal rights ordinance. In late July, the state Supreme Court ordered the city to either repeal the non-discrimination law or vote to affirm it and place it before voters. City Council opted for the latter with a 12-5 vote.
'Deceptive ballot language'
Plaintiff Jared Woodfill said he was pleased with the decision but frustrated that the court had to step in at all. Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, also released a statement Wednesday calling for the Senate Intergovernmental Affairs Committee to look into the city's ""use of deceptive ballot language and continual erring on election procedure.""
""It's sad we've had to go to the Supreme Court twice,"" Woodfill said. ""It shows how vested the mayor is in this issue that she has broken the law twice.""
Parker fired back Wednesday, saying in a written statement that ""it is clear that politics is driving the law in this case.""
""We will rewrite the ballot language, but I strongly disagree with the decision and find it to be contrary to the court's established law regarding previous ballot initiatives.""
The decision, however, helps crystallize messaging for the two campaigns that have been quickly gearing up for an expensive battle since City Council placed the measure on the ballot in early August.
Opponents, for instance, had hesitated to run any ads before a ruling came down. Woodfill said the decision ""green lighted"" messaging for the campaign, which will now run ""vote no"" alongside their ""no men in women's restrooms"" tagline. Shortly after the decision Wednesday morning, supporters also released a statement encouraging residents to vote for the law.
""We're eager for the majority of Houstonians to vote 'FOR' keeping the city's valuable Equal Rights Ordinance,"" said Richard Carlbom, the campaign manager. ""Discrimination based on race, disability, military status, gender identity, sexual orientation, or age is not a Houston value and has no place in this city.""
The ruling rejected an argument from the ordinance's foes that the ballot should not contain the words ""Houston Equal Rights Ordinance,"" which they said was politically charged.
Bans several types of bias
The ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The law applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators could be fined up to $5,000.
Foes of the measure submitted a petition seeking to place the law on the ballot for repeal last summer following City Council's 11-6 approval of the ordinance. City Secretary Anna Russell initially counted enough valid signatures to qualify the petition for the ballot, but Parker and former City Attorney David Feldman threw out many of those because they appeared on pages of the petition they said had not been properly collected or notarized.
Foes sued, leading to a state district judge's ruling earlier this year that the petition did not have enough valid signatures and the subsequent Texas Supreme Court rulings this summer. Now, City Council will vote at its Aug. 26 meeting to place the new ballot language on the ballot.
At-large councilmen C.O. Bradford, an attorney, said Wednesday that council should have heeded his warning two weeks ago not to use repeal language on the ballot.
""I tried my damndest to save the mayor and City Council members from this utter embarrassment,"" Bradford said. ""It's sad that council continues to embarrass itself.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,866,93.42,29.2,32.31,23.14,22.21,29.45,81.87,55.43,44.46,6.47,2.08,0.35,0.58,0,0.46,0.58,4.39,17.55,11.09,1.39,13.05,5.54,2.42,4.97,1.39,11.2,4.85,2.89,9.47,1.15,0.46,7.85,10.39,0.58,9.58,1.73,1.39,0.92,1.5,0.12,4.5,0,3.23,1.73,1.5,0.92,0.12,0.81,0,0.23,0.23,0,12.24,7.16,0.46,0.23,1.15,0.69,3,3.7,0.12,0,0.35,0.35,8.66,8.55,0.12,0,2.66,0,0.35,1.96,0.23,0.23,0.46,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.46,0,0,0.81,0,0.12,0.35,0.23,0,0.12,0.35,0,2.66,7.04,0.46,1.04,4.85,0.92,0,0,4.5,5.31,1.96,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,17.78,4.62,5.77,0,0,2.19,5.2,0,0.12,0.12,0,0.23,0.46,3.67,4.12,3.64,4.17,3.12,-3.51,-2.34,-0.43,-0.33,-1.87,1.16,0.58,0.12,0,2.89,0.35,0.12,0,1.5,0,0.23,0.23,3.13,0.12,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,2.06,1.22,19.17,150.46,1.27,208.33,-0.35,162.04,1.39,254.63,2.55,115.74,-0.69,358.8,1.74,474.54,0,150.46,0,46.3,0.46,11.57,0,11.57,254.63,150.46,34.72,0,46.3,0.23,69.44,57.87,23.15,23.15,11.57,0,0,81.02,138.89,57.87,0,46.3,0,0.46,1,0.23,0.35,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,0,1

AUSTIN ‚Äî Houston City Council used the wrong language when it put its nondiscrimination ordinance for gay and transgender residents on the November election ballot, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
As part of the ongoing legal challenge to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also known as HERO, the council placed the issue on the ballot asking voters whether the city should repeal the ordinance.
But the court ruled the Houston council must reword the language because the vote should be on whether to affirm the ordinance, not repeal it.
That means the ordinance will not take effect unless voters say so.
‚ÄúThough the ordinance is controversial, the law governing the City Council‚Äôs duties is clear,‚Äù the justices wrote. ‚ÄúOur decision rests not on our views on the ordinance ‚Äî a political issue the citizens of Houston must decide ‚Äî but on the clear dictates of the City Charter.‚Äù
The council put the ordinance up for public vote after the Supreme Court ruled in July that it must be repealed by Aug. 24 or placed on the November ballot.
Passed in 2014 after an intense public debate, the ordinance would expand the city‚Äôs ban on discrimination to include protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at businesses that serve the public.
The protections also apply to city contractors and municipal workers. Petition drive
The passage of the ordinance was challenged by conservative activists and pastors who led a petition drive calling for a referendum or a repeal.
But city officials ruled that those efforts failed to draw enough signatures. Opponents of the ordinance then took the issue to the courts, alleging in a lawsuit that the city inappropriately disqualified some of the signatures.
After a state district judge ruled in favor of the city in April, the Texas Supreme Court then directed the council ‚Äúto comply with its duties‚Äù in considering a valid referendum petition.
At least nine Texas cities with populations of more than 100,000 have passed nondiscrimination rules offering lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents some degree of protections against discrimination.
Cities like Dallas, Austin and Fort Worth have had those protections in place for at least a decade, while Houston, San Antonio and Plano joined that list in the last two years.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,376,97.81,28.37,31.25,39.61,23.5,25,78.72,56.12,46.01,4.26,0.8,0,0.53,0,0,0,3.46,19.41,14.1,1.33,14.36,3.99,1.33,7.98,0.8,8.51,4.52,3.46,7.98,0.8,1.06,6.12,9.31,0,9.04,1.6,1.6,1.86,0.53,0.53,4.26,0,1.86,1.6,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.31,3.99,0.27,0,0.53,1.06,1.33,2.39,0,0,0.27,0,6.38,6.38,0,0,2.93,0,0.53,1.86,0.53,0.27,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,1.33,0,0,0.53,0,0.53,0,0.27,0,0,1.33,0,1.86,7.45,0,1.6,5.59,0.27,0,0,4.26,3.19,1.06,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,10.37,4.26,3.99,0,0,0.53,1.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.5,4.3,3.39,4.36,2.99,-5.05,-2.15,-1.67,-1.38,-2.52,1.07,0,0,0,1.07,0.53,0,0,1.33,0,0,0.27,2.13,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.65,0.48,15.21,160,1.6,186.67,-0.8,133.33,1.07,213.33,2.13,53.33,-0.53,186.67,0.8,346.67,0,80,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,240,53.33,80,0,53.33,0,53.33,80,0,26.67,0,0,0,80,53.33,106.67,133.33,0,0,0.8,1,0.52,1.31,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.52,0.52,0.52,0,1
8/20/15,16,Public Policy,Houstonians Will be Voting for the Equal Rights Ordinance in November ,"
HOUSTON, Aug. 19 -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas issued the following news release:
The Texas Supreme Court this morning ruled that the majority of Houstonians who support the city's Equal Rights Ordinance will be casting a ballot ""for"" the measure to keep it on the books.
""We're eager for the majority of Houstonians to vote 'FOR' keeping the city's valuable Equal Rights Ordinance,"" said Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites. ""Discrimination based upon race, disability, military status, gender identity, sexual orientation or age is not a Houston value and has no place in this city. A vote FOR HERO is a vote for treating everyone fairly and equally under the law.""
The Houston City Council will be deciding the final ballot language next week.
Voters this fall will decide whether they continue to support ending legal discrimination in employment, housing and in restaurants and shops based upon race, age, disability, veteran status, gender identity or sexual orientation. More than half of the claims filed under HERO (according to the City of Houston's Office of the Inspector General) when it was on the books, were based on racial discrimination.",Houston Unites,1,191,96.16,34.1,36.58,83.23,23.88,27.23,80.1,56.54,41.36,5.24,1.57,0,0.52,0,0,0.52,3.66,13.61,10.47,0.52,14.14,5.76,1.05,4.71,1.05,12.04,4.71,4.71,7.85,1.05,0,6.81,8.9,1.05,7.33,1.05,1.57,0,1.57,0,4.19,0,4.19,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.95,6.28,1.05,0,1.57,1.05,1.05,3.66,0,0,0,0,7.85,6.81,1.05,0,5.76,0.52,0.52,4.19,0.52,0,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,1.05,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,1.57,5.76,0,0.52,5.76,0,0,0,4.71,2.09,2.09,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,19.9,4.19,6.81,0,0,3.14,5.76,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,4.56,5.63,4.42,4.25,4,-2.05,-1.9,0.72,-0.4,-1.33,0.52,1.05,0,0,2.62,1.57,0.52,0,0.52,0,0,1.05,1.57,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.82,1.86,23.07,209.42,2.09,575.92,0.52,52.36,0.52,209.42,2.09,104.71,-1.05,523.56,2.09,785.34,0,52.36,0,0,0,52.36,0,104.71,209.42,52.36,0,0,104.71,1.05,104.71,209.42,104.71,0,0,0,0,104.71,52.36,209.42,0,52.36,0,0,1,1.57,2.09,0,0,0,0,1.05,0,1.57,0,0,0,1

8/19/15,16,News,Texas high court find flaw in Houston LGBT ordinance ,"
The Houston City Council used the wrong language when it put its nondiscrimination ordinance for gay and transgender residents on the November election ballot, the Texas Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
As part of the ongoing legal challenge to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also known as HERO, the council placed the issue on the ballot asking voters whether the city should repeal the ordinance. But the court ruled the council must reword the language because the vote should be on whether to affirm the ordinance, not repeal it.
That means the ordinance will not take effect unless voters say so.
""Though the ordinance is controversial, the law governing the City Council‚Äôs duties is clear,"" the justices wrote. ""Our decision rests not on our views on the ordinance ‚Äî a political issue the citizens of Houston must decide ‚Äî but on the clear dictates of the City Charter.""
The council put the ordinance up for public vote after the Supreme Court ruled in July that it must be repealed by Aug. 24 or placed on the November ballot.
Passed in 2014 after an intense public debate, the ordinance would expand the city‚Äôs ban on discrimination to include protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity at businesses that serve the public. The protections also apply to city contractors and municipal workers.
The passage of the ordinance was challenged by conservative activists and pastors who led a petition drive calling for a referendum or a repeal. But city officials ruled that those efforts failed to draw enough signatures. Opponents of the ordinance then took the issue to the courts, alleging in a lawsuit that the city inappropriately disqualified some of the signatures.
After a state district judge ruled in favor of the city in April, the Supreme Court then directed the council ‚Äúto comply with its duties‚Äù in considering a valid referendum petition.
At least nine Texas cities with populations of more than 100,000 have passed nondiscrimination rules offering lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents some degree of protections against discrimination.
Cities like Dallas, Austin and Fort Worth have had those protections in place for at least a decade, while Houston, San Antonio and Plano joined that list in the last two years.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,372,97.98,28.25,30.58,39.85,23.25,24.73,79.57,56.99,46.77,4.3,0.81,0,0.54,0,0,0,3.49,19.89,14.52,1.34,14.52,4.03,1.34,8.06,0.81,8.6,4.57,3.49,8.06,0.81,1.08,6.18,9.41,0,9.14,1.61,1.61,1.88,0.54,0.54,4.3,0,1.88,1.61,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9.41,4.03,0.27,0,0.54,1.08,1.34,2.42,0,0,0.27,0,6.45,6.45,0,0,2.96,0,0.54,1.88,0.54,0.27,1.88,0,0,0,0,0,1.34,0,0,0.54,0,0.54,0,0.27,0,0,1.34,0,1.61,7.26,0,1.34,5.65,0.27,0,0,4.3,3.23,1.08,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,10.48,4.3,4.03,0,0,0.54,1.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.48,4.3,3.37,4.32,2.99,-4.97,-2.12,-1.66,-1.36,-2.47,1.08,0,0,0,1.08,0.54,0,0,1.35,0,0,0.27,2.16,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.67,0.49,15.1,161.73,1.62,188.68,-0.81,134.77,1.08,188.68,1.89,53.91,-0.54,188.68,0.81,323.45,0,80.86,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,242.59,53.91,80.86,0,53.91,0,53.91,80.86,0,26.95,0,0,0,80.86,53.91,107.82,134.77,0,0,0.81,1,0.53,1.06,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.53,0.53,0.53,0,1

8/17/15,16,B,Equal rights battle broils - Dueling efforts to swing ballots begin campaigns ,"When City Council sent Houston's embattled equal rights ordinance to the November ballot two weeks ago, the vote raised the curtain on dueling campaigns that had been bracing in the wings for a political showdown more than a year in the making.
Council's 12-5 vote to affirm the ordinance and place it on the ballot, part of a Texas Supreme Court order, followed months of heated back-and-forth in City Hall and various Harris County courtrooms. By the next week, campaign managers had been selected, ads were drafted and pollsters were working to take the pulse of voters.
Supporters quickly appealed to Houston-native and superstar Beyonc√© on Twitter for a plug. Opponents, meanwhile, touted presidential candidate Rand Paul's remarks during the national GOP debates chiding Mayor Annise Parker, though not by name, for a political fumble during the court case surrounding the law. Both camps warned that the eyes of the nation are on Houston.
Political scientists, however, said that is a tad dramatic; unless the law is repealed, the fight over Houston's non-discrimination law will amount to a largely local affair bolstered by some national money.
Opponents will push a public safety campaign driven by the perceived threat that male sexual predators dressed in drag will use the law as cover to enter women's restrooms. Supporters, meanwhile, will seek to debunk that and warn that repealing the law would irreparably harm the city's image.
Both groups said they will need to spend at least $2 million to pepper voters with targeted direct mail and a few choice ads.
""HERO will be competing head to head with the mayoral election for oxygen and energy,"" said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. ""There's only so much space in an election like this, and a lot of that space is going to be occupied by HERO because it's a charged issue. It's going to make it even more difficult for down-ballot races to emerge and obtain the attention of voters.""
Under the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, is banned. Opponents largely criticize the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting are subject to the ordinance and could face fines of up to $5,000 for violations. Religious organizations are exempt.
Opponents of the measure submitted a petition to place the law on the ballot for repeal last summer following City Council's 11-6 approval of the ordinance. City officials rejected the petition, saying it was riddled with errors and did not contain the needed 17,269 valid signatures from Houston residents. That triggered a lawsuit from opponents and the subsequent district court and state Supreme Court rulings ordering the council to repeal the ordinance or place it on the November ballot.
Twofold task for supporters
At dueling launch events last week, both sides offered a glimpse of the campaigns to come.
On Wednesday, equal rights ordinance supporters unveiled the ""Houston Unites"" campaign.
Leslie Jackson, the minister of education at Cathedral of Hope church in Midtown, said opponents ""confuse religious freedom with the freedom to discriminate.""
""Religious faith does not undermine the value of equality for all under the law,"" Jackson said. ""Religious faith demands it. As a Christian minister, I must oppose misguided efforts to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.""
The task for supporters, Campaign Manager Richard Carlbom said, is twofold: explaining the ramifications if the ordinance is repealed and countering opponents' contention that male sexual predators will use the ordinance to enter women's restrooms.
""Houston and Houstonians don't believe in discrimination, and so, HERO simply says everybody should be free from discrimination and that's why folks should support it,"" Carlbom said.
The challenge for supporters is to fend off the public safety allegations without losing their own message, University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said. The business angle - that events such as the Super Bowl and Final Four could go elsewhere in the event of repeal - likely will factor into supporters' argument, he said.
The onus, he said, largely falls on opponents of the ordinance to turn the tide as LGBT issues continue to pick up public support. As the ordinance was embroiled in litigation, a slew of states and then the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage.
""In part, because it's hard to get people to undo something, opponents have a harder job,"" Rottinghaus said. ""Once the inertia is developed in a certain direction, it's hard to get people to do something different.""
Jared Woodfill, former Harris County GOP chairman and a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the ordinance, said opponents would target female voters and men concerned about the safety of their wives and daughters. The pitch to voters, Woodfill said, is simple: ""No men in women's restrooms.""
'We have fought for a year'
Foes hosted a launch event Thursday night, ""Faith, Family and Freedom Tour Across Texas,"" that featured among its speakers former Congressman Tom DeLay, Woodfill, Texas Eagle Forum's Cathie Adams, and local conservative activist Dr. Steve Hotze.
Andy Taylor, an attorney for the opponents, previewed what is likely to be the group's two main contentions - that Parker intentionally obstructed citizens' right to vote and that public safety is threatened by the law.
""We have fought for a year for something we all learned in the third grade was supposed to be guaranteed to each and every one of us,"" Taylor said. ""Mayor Parker, go back to civics class and read the Constitution. Because we're going to send a message, powerful, not just for Houston, not through Texas, but throughout the United States that we don't want men in women's restrooms.""
The group also will use its leverage in local churches, where U.S. Pastor Council head Dave Welch has been working to mobilize voters since the issue first came before City Council in 2014. The messaging will touch on the group's contentious relationship with Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city. In particular, Woodfill said, opponents will highlight the city's subpoena of sermons in the court case opponents filed last year.
As part of a broad discovery request, the city's legal team sought sermons belonging to pastors who led the charge against the ordinance. Parker eventually withdrew the subpoenas amid national backlash and conservative criticism that the administration was infringing on religious liberty.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1083,94.95,53.85,14.08,18.06,23.54,28.07,79.96,55.59,42.57,4.43,1.2,0.09,0.55,0,0.18,0.28,3.23,14.31,9.97,1.39,14.13,6,2.49,5.36,0.74,12.56,5.91,3.79,8.49,1.85,0.65,6.09,8.13,0.46,7.57,0.74,1.48,1.29,1.29,0.18,2.86,0,3.6,1.66,1.85,0.37,0.09,0.18,0,0.09,0,0,11.27,5.82,0.37,0.09,1.75,0.46,2.4,5.45,0.46,0,0.65,0.65,5.17,4.99,0.18,0,4.71,0.18,0.37,2.59,0.37,1.39,1.66,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.83,0.18,0,0.28,0.18,0.37,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.37,2.95,7.76,0.46,1.57,5.26,0.28,0,0.37,3.14,3.97,2.49,1.94,0,0,0,0,0,18.74,4.89,7.39,0,0,2.68,3.79,0,0.37,0,0.18,0,0.18,3.82,4.05,3.62,4.11,3.24,-3.38,-1.79,-0.43,-0.51,-1.2,0.18,0.83,0.37,0.37,1.66,0.37,0.83,0,0.55,0,1.39,0.28,1.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.31,1.15,19.1,157.12,1.11,258.78,-0.46,157.12,0.83,332.72,2.5,83.18,-0.46,323.48,0.65,397.41,0,157.12,0.09,110.91,1.11,18.48,0,46.21,212.57,92.42,46.21,9.24,46.21,-0.28,120.15,73.94,9.24,46.21,0,0,0,92.42,83.18,120.15,64.7,9.24,9.24,1.02,1,0.28,0.74,0.09,0,0,0,0.28,0,0.28,0.28,0.09,0.37,1
8/17/15,16, B,Equal rights battle broils - Dueling efforts to swing ballots begin campaigns ,"
When City Council sent Houston's embattled equal rights ordinance to the November ballot two weeks ago, the vote raised the curtain on dueling campaigns that had been bracing in the wings for a political showdown more than a year in the making.
Council's 12-5 vote to affirm the ordinance and place it on the ballot, part of a Texas Supreme Court order, followed months of heated back-and-forth in City Hall and various Harris County courtrooms. By the next week, campaign managers had been selected, ads were drafted and pollsters were working to take the pulse of voters.
Supporters quickly appealed to Houston-native and superstar Beyonc√© on Twitter for a plug. Opponents, meanwhile, touted presidential candidate Rand Paul's remarks during the national GOP debates chiding Mayor Annise Parker, though not by name, for a political fumble during the court case surrounding the law. Both camps warned that the eyes of the nation are on Houston.
Political scientists, however, said that is a tad dramatic; unless the law is repealed, the fight over Houston's non-discrimination law will amount to a largely local affair bolstered by some national money.
Opponents will push a public safety campaign driven by the perceived threat that male sexual predators dressed in drag will use the law as cover to enter women's restrooms. Supporters, meanwhile, will seek to debunk that and warn that repealing the law would irreparably harm the city's image.
Both groups said they will need to spend at least $2 million to pepper voters with targeted direct mail and a few choice ads.
""HERO will be competing head to head with the mayoral election for oxygen and energy,"" said Rice University political scientist Mark Jones. ""There's only so much space in an election like this, and a lot of that space is going to be occupied by HERO because it's a charged issue. It's going to make it even more difficult for down-ballot races to emerge and obtain the attention of voters.""

HOUSTON, Aug. 13 -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas issued the following news release:
Following tonight's event sponsored by opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) at the Hilton Post Oak, Pastor Rudy Rasmus, senior pastor at St. John's Church, issued the following statement:
""We thought tonight's gathering was to oppose Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance, but the group instead began raising issues that aren't even on the ballot. All of us care about privacy and safety in bathrooms and nothing in HERO changes that. But the question on the ballot is simple: Do Houstonians support treating others as they wish to be treated? I submit to you most of us believe we are all God's children and deserve protection from discrimination - no matter someone's race, religion, gender identity, veterans status or sexual orientation.""

8/13/15,16,Public Policy,Houston Unites Launches Campaign to Support Equal Rights Ordinance ,"HOUSTON, Aug. 12 -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas issued the following news release:
Today, the Houston Unites campaign launched to prevent the repeal of Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) on the November ballot. Houston is the most diverse city in the country, but is also the only city of its size in the country lacking an equal rights ordinance. HERO's anti-discrimination protections extend to fifteen separate categories -- including race, gender, gender identity, veteran status, disability, age and sexual orientation -- and would provide Houstonians with a local recourse to discrimination complaints that is timely, effective and affordable.
Members of the Houston Unites coalition voiced their support for the ordinance and urged Houston voters to educate themselves on the protections for all citizens:
Dr. James M. Douglas, President, NAACP Houston Branch: ""The NAACP has and will always be focused on the elimination of discrimination against all people. As an organization, we have always been and will continue to be inclusive, not exclusive. HERO is not just about black, brown or red. HERO is also not just about male and female. Instead, HERO is about every one of us. Hopefully, we can continue to grow as a city by recognizing that we are all members of the human race and that the only way we can achieve our goal of becoming a great city is by accepting the rights of all of us to equally participate in this society we call Houston, Texas.""
Bobby Singh, Principal, Isani Consultants, L.P.: ""If we fail to protect HERO in November, we're sending a clear message to the rest of the country that we aren't a business-friendly destination. That depending on who you are, we might not want to do business with you. And that's wrong. Every person in our city deserves the chance to be successful and to live and work without fear of discrimination.""
Leslie Jackson, Minister at Cathedral of Hope Houston: ""I know the stories of those who have faced discrimination because of who they are or whom they love. They are our neighbors, our coworkers, our friends and family members. I believe Jesus calls me and all Christians to treat them with dignity and respect and to oppose, with determination, the discrimination they have faced.""
Ann Elder, mother of a transgender child: ""HERO is important to me because it will ensure my son, whom I am so proud of and love dearly, can grow up safe and sound. I know my boy has a bright future and so much to offer. HERO is about ensuring he and all children can reach their full potential.""
Sonia Corrales, Chief Program Officer, Houston Area Women's Center: ""As the Chief Program Officer of the Houston Area Women's Center, the safety of women and children is my first priority. I've worked my entire career to protect women and to support those who have experienced violence. Sexual assault is a terrible crime that affects people in every community. It's real; it's scary; and it has absolutely nothing to do with our city's equal rights ordinance.""
Rabbi Roy A. Walter, Rabbi Emeritus, Congregation Emanu El: ""We are all God's children, regardless of our religious beliefs, our race or ethnicity, our sex or age, our sexual orientation or gender identity. No one has a monopoly on God's love. And we all have the right to live our lives free from discrimination.""
Houston Unites is the coalition working to elevate the diversity of voices supporting HERO. The leading coalition partners include: ACLU of Texas, Equality Texas, Freedom For All Americans, Human Rights Campaign, NAACP Houston Branch and Texas Freedom Network.",Houston Unites,1,601,67.29,93.02,16.01,84.68,19.39,25.62,86.19,60.07,49.75,11.31,8.65,1.83,3.99,0.33,0.17,1.33,2.66,14.64,6.82,0.67,12.81,7.99,3.16,6.66,1.16,11.81,5.66,4.16,12.65,6.49,1.83,4.49,12.31,3.49,8.82,0.83,0.83,1.66,2,0.33,4.33,0,6.66,5.49,1.16,1.5,1,0.5,0.33,0,0,0,21.3,7.49,1.33,0,1.5,2.5,1,14.48,0.33,0.17,1,0.67,3,2.5,0.5,0,3.99,0,0.17,2,0.67,1.5,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,0.67,0,0,0,0.5,0.17,0.17,0.17,0,0.33,1.16,0,4.49,6.82,0.5,0.33,5.32,0.67,0.17,0,1.83,0.67,5.66,1.33,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,20.47,5.66,7.15,0,0,2.16,5.49,0,1,0,0.67,0.17,0.83,4.63,4.72,3.96,3.84,3.73,-0.6,0.63,2.18,1.24,1.26,0.33,1.33,1.16,0.33,1.5,1,2.16,0,1.33,0,1.16,0.5,0.83,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,3.08,1.42,20.96,133.11,0.33,632.28,1,183.03,1.5,332.78,2.5,99.83,-1,199.67,1,415.97,0,66.56,0.17,49.92,0.5,16.64,0,116.47,183.03,166.39,83.19,0,33.28,0,133.11,133.11,99.83,33.28,0,0,0,33.28,0,199.67,49.92,49.92,16.64,1.33,1,1,2,0.17,0,0.17,0,0.5,0,1,0,0.17,0.33,1

8/12/15,16,B,Let's wait - A term limit vote shouldn't be placed in the shadow of the equal rights ordinance. ,"After years of study and debate, term limits have almost made their way to the November ballot - and the timing couldn't be worse. Everyone's attention is on the Houston equal rights ordinance, and City Coucnil should keep it that way.
At today's City Council meeting, our elected local representatives are scheduled to decide whether Houston should have a referendum vote on changing term limits. An ad hoc committee on charter reform, which included each council member, has recommended that the question be put up to the voters. The choice would be between the status quo or a White House model - keeping our current system of three, two-year terms or shifting to two, four-year terms for the mayor, controller and City Council members.
Houston's term limits have a structural influence on the way that business gets done in our local government, and political observers have argued about their efficacy dating back to their original implementation in a 1991 referendum. These pages have long advocated for changing or eliminating this barrier to voters selecting the candidates of their choice.
However, it is difficult to have a thorough conversation about this topic when the fight over Houston's equal rights ordinance is sucking up all the oxygen in the room. If the so-called HERO is going to be on the November ballot, then City Council would be smart to ensure that it doesn't have to share the spotlight.
Referendum-style government risks radical policy swings based more on turnout than a true political will. Emotional arguments and inflamed passions risk overshadowing an important vote on term limits - one that deserves greater focus than a runner-up position.
While we agreed with the ad hoc committee on charter reform at the time, new facts on the ground should lead council members to reconsider their votes. Beyond the fight over the equal rights ordinance, changes to fundraising laws also raise additional issues that haven't yet been considered. City Hall candidates used to be prohibited from raising money for 10 months between election cycles. This blackout ordinance, passed in 1992, was temporarily blocked by a federal judge earlier this year.
Under the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. FEC, monetary donations to political campaigns are protected as free speech. Houston policy makers have yet to comprehend the long-term local consequences of this ruling. Before moving forward on a vote, City Council should appoint a commission of experts to study how campaign fundraising interacts with term limits.
Houston is hot enough already, and campaigns don't really turn up the heat until after Labor Day. Let's wait for things to cool off before considering the dry, technical business of changing term limits.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,444,89.52,48.08,65.19,20.23,21.14,27.25,87.16,58.78,44.82,6.31,2.25,0,1.13,0,0,1.13,4.05,14.64,8.33,1.8,15.32,8.11,2.7,5.63,0.9,12.84,6.76,4.73,8.56,2.7,0.45,5.41,11.71,0.45,11.26,2.48,2.7,2.25,2.25,0.45,3.15,0,3.83,1.8,1.8,0.68,0,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,9.23,4.5,0.23,0,1.13,0.68,1.35,4.28,0,0,0,0,9.91,9.68,0,0.23,3.83,0,0.45,2.93,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.45,0.23,0,0,0.9,0,3.38,10.59,0.68,1.58,7.21,0.23,0,0.9,8.11,2.48,3.38,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,13.74,5.18,4.28,0,0,2.25,2.03,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,3.35,3.98,3.31,3.9,2.93,-2.04,-1,-0.89,-0.59,-1.08,0.68,0.68,0.23,0.45,1.58,0,0.23,0,0.68,0,0,0,1.13,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.75,1.08,21.5,180.18,0.23,135.14,0,270.27,2.25,225.23,2.03,202.7,-2.03,450.45,1.8,405.41,0,270.27,-0.68,0,0,0,0,90.09,157.66,22.52,0,22.52,22.52,0,157.66,67.57,22.52,22.52,45.05,0.45,0,157.66,22.52,405.41,0,0,0,1.13,1,0,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

8/11/15,16,B,LETTERS ,"Personal choice
Regarding ""Anti-HERO campaign will sow division where it should not be"" (Page B13, Sunday), the Rev. Rudy Rasmus is spot-on with his statement that we should all love our neighbor and treat everyone with dignity and respect. But he misses the mark by failing to understand that the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) is not about love and dignity; it's about government.
We have the freedom to associate with whom we choose, but that implies that we also have the freedom to not associate with whom we choose. That is what ""discrimination"" is. Would Jesus approve? Probably not. But is it a crime? No way.
It's one thing for police to protect life and property from theft and violence. But HERO gives government agents the power to override personal choice and arrest and punish someone from exercising this basic right of association.
David M. Woods, Houston Must win
Regarding ""Skip the piousness and give Rice a call"" (Page C1, Monday), the column provided the perfect argument for why Ray Rice should be allowed to play in the NFL again: because the Texans need to win!
How have I missed why many sports players get to live by different rules from the rest of us? Of course, it's so their teams can win (Translate: Make money).
Why does it matter whether a young woman gets punched out in an elevator or another raped on a college campus? If sports teams don't keep an open mind about letting players who commit such acts play, well, they might lose!
Paige Hagle, Houston Just laughs
Regarding letter to the editor ""Bacon-fried"" (Page B7, Saturday), writer Pat Koenig was ""horrified"" by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz's rifle bacon stunt. Can we all stop overreacting and keep things in perspective? Aborted fetus body parts for sale is ""horrifying."" The Ted Cruz video was ""silly"" at worst (although I had a good chuckle when I read about it).
Diane Sulpizio, Houston Trump-worthy
Regarding too many articles and syndicated columns on ""the Don,"" and after much trenchant soul-searching, I've decided to like Donald Trump. His flaws are many: self-deprecating humor, over-the-top self-aggrandizement, self-well-almost-anything, and bad hair. But, other than the hair, these are also the things I like about him.
He's proud of what he's done. He's proud of who he is. He's proud of what he's built. He should be.
He knows he's flawed in areas of diplomacy, humility and political correctness. But being ""politically correct"" sometimes means tippy-toeing around the real issue and calling a spade a, well, heart (i.e., less dark, fewer sharp edges, easier to stomach). As president of the United States, he might be an abomination. Then again, he might not. Back in the day, Teddy Roosevelt was a boisterous, pompous reactionary and Ronald Reagan, on his best day, a B-actor. At the very least, he's likely convincing the GOP that candor and heart are not necessarily antithetical to campaigning and potentially winning an election. 
That's definitely something to like.

 ""Shall the City of Houston repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Ord.

Equal rights ordinance opponents on Friday sued Mayor Annise Parker for the second time this week, challenging the ballot language that will go to voters in November and marking yet another chapter in the protracted legal battle over her signature non- discrimination law.
At issue is whether the ballot item should ask voters if they favor repealing the law or not - or if they support implementing the law or not. City Council approved sending the equal rights ordinance to voters on Wednesday, under order from the Texas Supreme Court to either repeal the law or affirm it and place it on the November ballot.
Then, City Council tackled the ballot language. Attorney Andy Taylor, who represents the opponents, told City Council he believed City Charter does not allow for a suspended ordinance to be voted on by repeal - enforcement of the law has been tabled under the court's order. The current ballot language asks ""shall the city of Houston repeal the Equal Rights Ordinance,"" so a supporter of the law would vote against it, and an opponent would vote in favor.
In a news release, Taylor said Parker ""decided to play games with the language in an effort to confuse voters on the effect of a 'Yes' or 'No' vote."" Taylor said that those opposed to the ordinance might instinctively vote against a ballot item that pertains to the law without realizing that they should instead cast a vote in favor of repeal.
Taylor submitted an emergency request to the Texas Supreme Court on Friday morning and was granted an expedited schedule by early afternoon. The city must respond by Thursday and all ballot items face an Aug. 24 deadline.
Conservative activist Jared Woodfill, a plaintiff in the case along with Pastor F.N. Williams Sr., said opponents viewed the court's quick response as ""very positive.""
""The ballot language is deceptive, and it's unlawful,"" Woodfill said. ""And we believe the court again is going to hold her accountable for it.""
Parker issued a statement Friday, noting that the language on the ballot is similar to a sentence included in the repeal referendum petition that opponents submitted to the city last year. That petition asked voters to sign if they wanted the law repealed. She also pointed to a 1997 Texas Supreme Court ruling that gave the city the authority to craft ballot language for a referendum.
""This lawsuit isn't about whether the ballot language is easy to understand or complies with the law,"" Parker said in the statement. ""The pastors group is opposed to a Houston free of discrimination for all and will do anything they can to try to confuse the voters."" The equal rights ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
Conservative opponents submitted a petition to send the law to voters last summer, but city officials rejected it, saying it was riddled with errors and did not contain the needed 17,269 valid signatures from Houston residents. That triggered a lawsuit from opponents and the subsequent district court and Supreme Court rulings.
On Monday, opponents again filed suit against Parker, seeking unspecified court costs and other damages associated with the earlier lawsuit. Three pastors also are suing Parker for damages and legal costs incurred when the city, as part of a broad discovery request, issued subpoenas that included a demand for certain sermons. Those subpoenas eventually were pulled down amid significant backlash.
Parker took flak for that incident in remarks made by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., during Thursday night's GOP presidential candidates debate. Through a spokeswoman, Parker declined to comment on the remarks.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,737,94.67,21.68,23.35,18.63,21.06,28.77,79.24,53.87,41.38,5.02,1.49,0,0.14,0,0.54,0.68,3.53,14.38,10.45,1.09,13.16,4.48,2.17,6.11,1.09,10.85,4.21,2.71,8.28,0.27,0.41,7.6,11.26,0.68,10.58,1.22,1.49,1.49,2.17,0.27,5.43,0,2.04,0.95,1.09,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,11.13,6.51,0.54,0.41,1.36,0.14,2.58,2.85,0.41,0,0.54,0.27,6.38,5.97,0.27,0.14,3.39,0.27,0.41,1.63,0.41,0.81,0.95,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.81,0,0,0.41,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,1.76,5.43,0.14,0.41,4.61,0.41,0,0,4.48,3.8,2.44,1.22,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,18.18,5.16,8.14,0.14,0,1.36,3.39,0,0.14,0,0,0,0.41,4.27,4.79,3.86,4.55,3.51,-4.07,-1.92,-0.38,-0.31,-2.42,0.27,0.68,0,0.41,3.12,0.54,0.27,0,1.22,0.14,0.54,0.27,3.12,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.92,1.24,17.06,189.96,1.63,244.23,-0.54,257.8,2.31,189.96,1.9,81.41,-0.41,312.08,0.81,393.49,0,94.98,-0.14,67.84,0.68,13.57,0,13.57,244.23,40.71,27.14,27.14,13.57,0,81.41,108.55,27.14,67.84,13.57,0,0,108.55,135.69,54.27,0,27.14,0,0.41,1,0.54,0.68,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,0.54,0,0,0,1

8/6/15,16,National,Houston council moves transgender 'bathroom bill' to November ballot ,"Houston voters will decide in November whether to repeal the city's hotly contested equal-rights ordinance, also known as the transgender ""bathroom bill,"" after a Wednesday vote of the city council.
The council voted 13-4 in favor of a ballot measure that asks voters whether to repeal the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), which bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity and other characteristics, requiring businesses open to the public to allow opposite-sex bathroom use.
The council, which passed the ordinance in May 2014, had little choice after the Texas Supreme Court ruled July 24 that the city had violated its charter by overruling the city secretary's approval of petitions to place the measure on the ballot.
The decision represents an enormous victory for the pastor-led coalition fighting the ordinance, but the ballot language approved Wednesday by the council could ignite another court fight.
The four council members who voted against the ballot measure argued that language should be framed so that voters who oppose the ordinance would be able to vote ""no"" on the HERO, instead of ""yes"" on the repeal.
At Wednesday's meeting, which was live-streamed, the council rejected an amendment to reframe the ballot language brought by council member C.O. Bradford. His proposal would have asked the voters, ""Shall the city of Houston implement"" the equal-rights ordinance.
""I guess it'll be back to the courthouse again and that's unfortunate, because we could get it right and we could move this thing forward for the voters to vote on it, and not spend hundreds of thousands of additional dollars,"" Mr. Bradford said. ""But I think that's where we are.""
Council member Michael Kubosh accused Mayor Annise Parker and other council members of trying to stack the deck in favor of the ordinance, calling the approved ballot language ""very confusing.""
""So when somebody walks in, the natural reaction to most people in a proposition is to vote 'no,'"" Mr. Kubosh said. ""There's a lot of 'no' voters that will vote 'no' no matter what the ordinance is. I think the language is a purposeful attempt to mislead voters and I think council member Bradford's ‚Äî laugh all you want, mayor‚Äîcouncil member Bradford's proposition is clear and direct, in your words, and does not mislead voters.""
""You need a proposition that states, if you want HERO implemented, you vote 'yes.' If you do not want HERO implemented, you vote 'no,'"" Mr. Kubosh said.
Council member Ellen Cohen countered that, ""I guess I put a lot more stock into the intelligence of the Houston city voters than perhaps some of my colleagues.""
""What we're proposing is, 'Shall the city of Houston repeal?' Those six words, I don't think, are confusing,"" Ms. Cohen said. ""As opposed to, 'Shall the city of Houston implement?' I think that's confusing.""
Other council members pointed out that the approved language meshed closely with the language in the petition to overturn the ordinance, but council member David Martin argued the city charter calls for an affirmative vote to overturn an ordinance.
The charter says that ""such ordinances or resolutions shall not take effect"" unless a majority of voters ""vote in favor thereof,"" he said. [T]he charter tells us, not a petition, not anything else, that we must put an ordinance on the ballot where qualified voters at such elections shall vote 'in favor,'"" Mr. Martin said. ""So 'in favor' means, 'Yes, implement HERO.' A vote against it means, 'No, do not implement HERO,' according to the city charter.""
When asked if the language was consistent with the charter, however, First Assistant City Attorney Deidra Penny said that it was. ""The language that was originally proposed is consistent with the city charter and the Supreme Court decisions,"" Ms. Penny said.
The high court gave the Houston city council 30 days either to repeal the ordinance or place it on the November ballot. Shortly before moving the ordinance to the ballot at Wednesday's meeting, the council voted 12-5 to keep the law in place.
Several pastors filed a lawsuit Monday seeking unspecified court costs and damages from the city incurred when the city issued subpoenas last year for sermons as part of the ongoing legal fight.
""This new lawsuit is not about civil rights or religious freedom,"" said Ms. Parker in a Monday statement. ""It's about politics. It is being waged by a small group that wants to take Houston backward instead of moving it forward.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,739,85.09,36.96,37.56,29.33,21.74,25.85,83.63,59,47.36,8.8,3.65,1.22,0.81,0.95,0.41,0,5.14,17.86,11.1,1.35,11.64,6.22,3.11,5.28,2.17,13.53,3.25,4.06,6.22,2.3,0.54,3.52,13.67,1.49,12.18,2.03,1.35,1.76,1.89,0,5.41,0,3.92,2.3,1.62,0.81,0.14,0.68,0,0.27,0,0,17.32,9.2,0.95,0.95,1.35,0.95,3.11,6.5,0,0,0.41,0.95,5.55,5.55,0,0,4.06,0,0,2.98,0.95,0.27,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0.41,0.54,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.52,7.04,0.41,1.08,5.55,0,0,0,3.25,4.06,3.65,1.62,0.41,0,0.41,0,0,23.68,5.41,6.36,0.27,0,4.87,6.77,0,0.27,0,0.14,0,0,3.44,3.71,3.57,3.77,2.7,-2.38,-1.63,-0.34,0.07,-0.67,0.27,0,0,0.54,0.68,0.41,0.27,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0.68,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.61,1.29,16.32,148.85,1.22,202.98,0.54,324.76,2.98,175.91,1.76,13.53,-0.14,270.64,0.14,230.04,0,135.32,-0.14,27.06,0.27,0,0,0,202.98,40.6,0,13.53,67.66,0.14,108.25,81.19,0,121.79,27.06,0.27,0,94.72,13.53,148.85,13.53,94.72,40.6,0.27,1,0.41,1.08,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,1
8/6/15,16,B,Equal rights ordinance goes to voters - Council vote puts embattled law on November ballot following a yearlong battle over the controversial issue ,"
More than one year after City Council passed an equal rights ordinance that drew a flood of impassioned testimony, the same body again voted on the embattled law Wednesday, this time sending the issue to voters in November and officially unleashing warring campaigns that are likely to draw national attention.
That City Council found itself voting on the nondiscrimination law a second time was due to a fiercely fought, yearlong legal battle over the ordinance. Since City Council passed the ordinance 11-6 in May 2014, thousands of repeal petition signatures have been counted and parsed for errors, two lawsuits have been filed against Mayor Annise Parker and now millions in campaign donations are likely to pour in as both sides appeal to voters.
Last month, the state's highest court rejected a district judge's ruling siding with Parker and instead found that the city should have accepted a repeal petition that conservative foes submitted last summer. The court ordered City Council to either repeal the ordinance or send it to voters.
On Wednesday, City Council opted for the latter, voting 12-5 to affirm the ordinance and, in doing so, effectively placing the law on the November ballot for possible repeal. Councilwoman Brenda Stardig and Councilmen Oliver Pennington, Michael Kubosh, Jack Christie and Dave Martin voted to repeal the ordinance, mirroring their votes against the law in 2014. Councilman Dwight Boykins, who also voted against the ordinance last year, said he voted to affirm the ordinance Wednesday to honor the wishes of his constituents to vote on the matter.
Term-limited Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city, said this week that her ""temper is a little ragged and my patience has grown quite thin on this issue."" She will spend her last few months in office helping to raise money and campaign against a repeal but said she does not intend to become a ""poster child"" or devote all her time to the issue.
Critics have dinged Parker in the past for calling the issue a personal one.
""I don't see how anyone can see the men and women who come in and fill this council chamber on multiple Tuesday afternoons or to talk privately to them and not be moved,"" Parker said. ""Particularly for the transgender community, these are people who, in order to be comfortable in their own skin, often give up their families, their jobs, their income and accept a life of poverty just to be right with themselves. And how someone cannot be moved and not feel emotional, I do not understand. I mean the stories are heartbreaking.""
The equal rights ordinance bans discrimination based not just on sexual orientation and gender identity - the flash points for opponents - but also, as federal laws do, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
Conservative opponents submitted a petition to send the law to voters last summer, but city officials rejected it, saying it was riddled with errors and did not contain the needed 17,269 valid signatures from Houston residents. That triggered a lawsuit from opponents and the subsequent district court and Supreme Court rulings. Opponents organizing
On Wednesday, plaintiff and conservative activist Jared Woodfill said opponents were already organized for the campaign and reaching out to national groups for support. Earlier this week, opponents again filed suit against Parker, seeking unspecified court costs and other damages associated with the earlier lawsuit. Three pastors also are suing Parker for damages and legal costs incurred when the city, as part of a broad discovery request, issued subpoenas that included a demand for certain sermons. Those subpoenas eventually were pulled down amid significant backlash.
""The eyes of the country are going to be on Houston, Texas,"" Woodfill said. ""(Parker) tries to say that it's about racial discrimination, it's about handicapped people, that it's about ethnicity. But really what this is about is the LGBT agenda.""
Woodfill said the opponents' campaign is likely to focus on the perceived threat of male sexual predators dressed in drag entering women's restrooms. Foes have dubbed the measure the ""Sexual Predator Protection Act.""
The ordinance protects transgender residents' ability to use the restroom consistent with their gender expression, regardless of their biological sex, but puts the onus on the individual to prove he or she was a victim of discrimination.
Brad Pritchett, who has spearheaded the pro-equal rights ordinance effort, said he has anticipated that issue would take center stage. Just hours after City Council voted Wednesday, supporters already had launched a ""Houston Unites"" petition online.
""We know that the one thing they are going to talk about is the same stuff they've been pushing - this line of argument that's blatantly untrue,"" Pritchett said. ""So for us, it's an opportunity to really wage an aggressive public education campaign. This is an ordinance that protects all Houstonians.""
Around the dais Wednesday, council members largely reiterated why they opposed or supported the equal rights ordinance in 2014.
Pennington, who voted against the ordinance last year, cast a vote to repeal it Wednesday and said he thinks the law raises social issues that should not be handled in a legal setting.
""What we would be doing if this ordinance is adopted is passing along this problem to the courts and the lawyers,"" Pennington said. ""The problem that we have between the races and the problems between the different parts of our society are more complex than that, and it requires the politicians and the neighborhood people and all others to get involved.""
Councilman Robert Gallegos shared a personal story in supporting the ordinance. He said that about a decade ago, he applied for a sales position with a freight company in Houston. He was not given an interview, and instead ""basically told that I could go to apply in the Valley - I guess due to the fact that I'm Hispanic."" Gallegos said the incident was an ""insult,"" and he filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
'Protect the citizens'
""If we would have had this ordinance in place I could have gone to the Office of Inspector General and they could have done the inspection, which would have been a lot easier and a lot simpler,"" Gallegos said. ""I am supporting this due to the fact that we need to protect the citizens and the residents of the city of Houston.""
After passing the equal rights ordinance ballot language, City Council delayed a vote on another proposed ballot item that would change elected officials' terms from three two-year terms to two four-year terms. In order to meet a late-August deadline, council must vote on the issue next week.",Houston Unites,1,1145,82.75,43.66,25.02,19.19,23.85,26.2,83.49,61.4,47.69,9.17,4.28,0.79,0.61,0,1.31,1.14,4.89,16.24,9.69,1.57,12.58,7.16,3.32,5.85,0.87,14.85,5.07,4.02,6.9,1.22,0.79,4.89,10.13,0.44,9.61,1.48,0.87,1.48,1.57,0.26,4.28,0,2.45,1.14,1.22,0.61,0.09,0.44,0,0.35,0.09,0,12.58,5.15,0.44,0.17,1.4,0.17,2.18,5.94,0.17,0,0.7,0.96,4.98,4.54,0.35,0.09,3.93,0,0.44,2.62,0.79,0.26,1.22,0.17,0,0.09,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.35,0.09,0.35,0.09,0.09,0,0.17,0.79,0.09,3.67,6.64,0.35,1.57,4.28,0.44,0.09,0.09,4.8,5.68,3.58,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,15.98,4.37,6.2,0,0,1.4,4.02,0,0.61,0,0.26,0,0.09,3.58,3.89,3.31,3.74,2.95,-3.41,-2.32,-1.26,-1.35,-2,0.17,0.7,0.26,0.35,1.57,0.26,0.61,0,1.14,0,0.26,0.26,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.71,0.96,16.71,174.67,1.22,262.01,0,165.94,1.48,148.47,1.4,122.27,-1.05,296.94,0.09,340.61,0,87.34,0.17,61.14,0.61,0,0,34.93,174.67,87.34,69.87,26.2,52.4,-0.17,122.27,96.07,8.73,52.4,17.47,0.09,0,61.14,52.4,113.54,34.93,0,17.47,1.4,1,0.26,0.44,0,0.09,0,0,0.26,0,0.26,0.09,0.17,0,1

9/30/15,17,B,For At-Large 5 - Philippe Nassif has the energy and skills to be an effective council member. ,"
You have to say this about City Councilman Jack Christie: He's a conscientious public servant. Holding the At-Large 5 seat, the two- term incumbent is, in his words, ""a workhorse, not a show horse,"" is always well prepared and seems to get along with others on the council. For those reasons and others, we endorsed him in 2013 for a second term on the council. We cannot endorse him for a third.
Despite his work on the council and his record of service on the State Board of Education and on the Spring Branch school board before being elected to the council in 2011, we find it incongruous that a chiropractic physician who has taken a special interest in health care plans for city employees opposes vaccinations. He contends that they jeopardize children's health and that there are other, more effective ways to nurture natural immunity. He's best known for his comment two years ago that ""you don't die from the flu."" In our view, opposition to vaccinations goes against the overwhelming scientific consensus and is a dangerous position for an elected official to hold, particularly one whose experience is in medicine.
Christie, 67, faces four challengers: Sharon Moses, an attorney who works for the city of Houston; Philippe Nassif, a community organizer with Care USA; Brad Batteau, a real estate investor, and Charles Tahir SEE CORRECTION, a businessman with Allen Medical Services Inc.
Nassif is our choice for At-Large 5. Granted, the 30-year-old son of Mexican and Lebanese immigrants is young, but he's been involved in public service for more than a decade. He offers voters detailed positions on transportation and infrastructure, fiscal responsibility and quality-of-life issues. He would work, for example, to address growing income inequality in Houston by advocating for affordable housing and providing incentives for developers to provide controlled-price rental units in developments across the city. He also supports the Houston equal rights ordinance (which Christie opposes).
Nassif's business initiatives include a reassessment of parking-space requirements, making the city permitting process speedier and more transparent and energetically recruiting businesses to relocate to Houston, while also encouraging businesses around the world to invest here.
Obviously, Nassif can't match the incumbent's record of public service. As Christie pointedly reminded him during their joint interview with the Chronicle editorial board, ""I was doing public service before you were born."" True enough, but we're confident that the younger man has the energy, the intellect and the commitment to public service to be an effective council member.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,416,89.19,75.49,6.7,41.51,23.11,31.49,83.17,58.41,47.84,9.62,6.97,0.24,1.44,0.72,3.37,0.48,2.64,15.14,9.13,2.88,15.14,5.77,2.64,5.53,0.96,10.1,6.49,3.61,7.93,2.4,3.37,2.64,7.69,0.24,7.21,1.44,1.2,0.72,0.24,0.24,3.37,0.24,3.85,2.64,1.2,0.48,0.24,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,15.87,4.57,1.44,0,0.72,0,1.2,8.65,0.24,0,0,3.85,1.2,0.96,0.48,0,9.38,0,0.24,8.41,2.88,0,2.88,2.4,0.72,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.24,0.72,0,0.48,0,0.24,0,0.24,0.24,0,2.4,6.73,0,0.24,5.29,0.96,0,0,3.37,1.68,5.05,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,18.27,4.33,6.73,0,0,2.16,5.05,0,0.96,0,0.24,0,0,3.05,3.25,2.82,2.94,2.22,-1.08,-0.44,1.04,0.42,0.06,0.72,0.96,1.2,0.24,0.48,0.24,0.24,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,0.96,0.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.34,1.13,17.44,240.38,2.4,336.54,1.44,168.27,1.68,168.27,1.44,192.31,0,240.38,0.24,456.73,0,0,0,24.04,0.24,24.04,0,72.12,192.31,120.19,24.04,0,72.12,-0.24,120.19,96.15,0,24.04,0,0,0,120.19,0,144.23,48.08,0,0,0.24,1,0,0.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

9/29/15,17,B,For District B - Jerry Davis is the only candidate in this race who understands how City Hall works. ,"Jerry Davis is sick of ""bitch sessions."" Those are his words, not ours.
In their meeting with the Chronicle editorial board, Davis' opponents had little difficulty listing the problems that face District B. Illegal dumping, stray dogs and crime and lagging economic development continue to hamper the majority African-American district. The real challenge is in finding solutions.
""This is what plagues District B,"" Davis, who is running for his third term, said at the meeting. ""These are the types of things that we must stop.""
It isn't enough to complain. Davis wants answers. But when you're a district council member in a strong-mayor system, answers can be hard to come by.
""The mayor puts items on the agenda and that's how it goes,"" David said.
He points out that council members need to work with the mayor and department heads if they want to implement policy or make changes for their districts. In this race, Davis is the only candidate who understands how the system functions and how a council member can pull the levers of power at City Hall to benefit his constituents.
In the private sector, Davis, 42, serves as executive director of Making It Better, a nonprofit youth program.
In his time on council, he has worked to place security cameras to catch illegal dumpers. He also successfully promoted a controversial tax incentive to encourage Krogers to expand its distribution center in northeast Houston. While we question the efficacy of these enticements, it shows that Davis uses every tool at his disposal to fight for District B.
That district covers plenty of venerable neighborhoods, including the Fifth Ward and Acres Homes. It also includes plenty of real estate prime for development. Davis hopes to capitalize on that potential with a proposal to build a new police headquarters on city- owned land in his district. Mayor Annise Parker's idea to relocate that key station to a downtown office building has fallen through, and Davis' plan is one of the few solid ideas on the table.
The councilman said he supports the Houston equal rights ordinance, but only came to that position after talking with people and educating himself. It is an education that plenty of other politicians could use.
He also said that he supports looking at raising the revenue cap to help balance the city budget. ""You're talking pennies on the dollar per household,"" he said.
As Davis faces his third and final term, there is simply nobody else in this race who can match his knowledge and experience. Voters better start looking now for an effective replacement when term limits force him from office.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,438,80.43,78.24,8.35,44.12,16.22,24.43,82.88,59.59,47.49,12.56,6.39,0,0.68,0.46,3.88,0.68,6.16,15.53,7.31,1.14,14.38,5.02,3.42,5.25,0.68,11.19,5.71,4.11,7.08,2.05,2.51,2.51,10.96,0.91,10.05,3.2,2.05,2.05,1.14,0.46,2.05,0,5.02,3.2,1.6,0.68,0.23,0.46,0,0,0,0.23,15.53,5.25,0.46,0,0.46,0,3.65,8.68,0.23,0,0,3.88,2.05,1.83,0.23,0,7.31,0,0.68,5.25,1.83,0,0.91,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.46,0.68,0.23,0.46,0.68,0,1.37,0.23,0,3.2,8.22,0.46,1.83,5.71,0.46,0,0.23,3.65,2.28,6.39,1.14,0,0,0,0,0,15.3,6.16,4.57,0,0,1.6,2.97,0,0.46,0,0,0,0.23,3.24,3.56,3.09,3.36,2.63,-2.5,-1.78,-0.05,-1.37,-0.05,0.46,0.68,0.46,0.23,0.46,0,0,0,0.23,0.46,0,0.23,0.23,0.23,0.23,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.33,0.9,16.95,22.83,0.23,342.47,0,228.31,1.83,114.16,0.91,91.32,0,433.79,0.91,365.3,0,159.82,-0.23,0,0,0,0,68.49,182.65,45.66,0,22.83,91.32,0,91.32,91.32,45.66,68.49,22.83,0.23,0,136.99,0,114.16,0,0,0,1.14,1,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

9/28/15,17,B,For a third time - Brenda Stardig deserves a final term at City Hall. ,"When out-of-towners look at a place like District A, they probably see sprawl. When Houstonians look at it, they probably see home. Located roughly between Interstate 10 and U.S. 290, west of Loop 610 West, it is a district of single-family neighborhoods and feeder-road developments. Brenda Stardig is on the verge of completing her nonconsecutive second term as district councilwoman, and she has earned a third.
Stardig, 53, came into office with a r√©sum√© impressive in its breadth and depth of civic involvement. She served on her neighborhood civic club, was head of a superneighborhood, sat on a tax increment reinvestment zone, a chamber of commerce and the Houston-Galveston Area Council. However, she was booted after her first term in a low-turnout election and replaced by Helena Brown. Rather than a constructive member of council, District A found itself with a ineffective rabble-rouser representative. Two years later, voters put Stardig back on council, and she started to put important infrastructure projects back on track.
A real estate broker by trade, Stardig told the editorial board that she's spent her time on council trying to prioritize the needs over the wants of her district. She lists public safety, infrastructure and economic development as the top three concerns.
While she supported the creation of the ReBuild Houston program, Stardig told the editorial board that she is not confident in its implementation.
""I'm very much about the conservative approach of pay-as-you-go,"" she said. ""But I'm very unsettled in the implementation.""
On pensions, she said that the city has to keep its promises made to workers but also should transition to something more predictable than our current system.
""Right now there's a lot of unknowns because there's not access to the information necessary to calculate, to predict the future.""
Stardig said she opposed the Houston equal rights ordinance because she believed there were other ways to address discrimination. While we believe that Stardig was wrong in her vote, she fares much better than her opponent. Iesheia K. Ayers- Wilson, a 35-year-old tax preparer, told the editorial board that she thinks businesses should be allowed to discriminate against people based on religion.
Stardig has demonstrated that she has the skill to effectively represent her district, and voters should give her a final term.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,378,80.9,69.34,5.41,35.2,18,28.57,83.33,63.23,48.94,11.38,7.94,0.53,0.53,0,6.35,0.53,3.44,16.4,8.73,2.65,14.02,5.29,3.97,6.61,0.53,13.76,6.08,3.97,5.29,1.32,2.12,1.85,10.05,0,10.05,1.32,1.32,1.59,1.32,0.26,2.91,0,3.17,2.12,1.06,0.53,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,14.02,3.97,0.26,0,0.79,0.26,1.59,8.47,0,0,6.35,0,1.59,1.59,0,0,8.47,0.26,0.79,5.56,3.17,0.53,0.79,0.26,0,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,0,1.06,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0.26,0.53,0.26,3.97,9.79,0.53,1.06,7.41,1.32,0,0,3.97,5.29,4.5,1.85,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0,18.78,6.08,6.35,0,0,1.32,5.03,0,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,2.71,2.89,2.8,2.75,2.26,-2.29,-0.91,0.35,-0.48,-0.08,0.26,0.26,0.26,0,0.53,0.53,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.33,0.87,15.26,132.28,1.32,264.55,-0.53,238.1,1.32,132.28,1.32,26.46,0.26,264.55,1.06,423.28,0,158.73,0.26,26.46,0.26,26.46,0,0,132.28,52.91,0,26.46,26.46,0,132.28,52.91,26.46,26.46,26.46,0.26,0,79.37,0,132.28,0,0,26.46,0.53,1,0.26,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0,0,0.26,1

9/26/15,17,b,"Ups and downs - Farewell to Yogi, howdy to elegant Kajiya, and a special salute to Colbert. ","THUMBS UP
It ain't over 'til it's over, but it is for Yogi Berra, the most beloved baseball player in history. He passed away at age 90 this week. We had a front-row seat to his brilliance when he came to a fork in the road and took it to Houston in 1986 to begin a four-year run as the Astros' bench coach. We'll be at his funeral in spirit. ""Always go to other people's funerals,"" Yogi advised, ""otherwise they won't come to yours.""
THUMBS UP
Another brilliant athlete is making Houston home. The stunningly elegant Yuriko Kajiya, a principal with the Houston Ballet, is featured on this week's list of Next Generation Leaders from Time Magazine. Whether as the lead in ""Manon"" 10 days ago or in the current Fall Mixed Rep, the Japanese-born Kajiya has the ""it"" factor. She makes exceedingly difficult moves look effortless (can she fly?), bringing a nonpareil beauty to the Brown Theater stage.
THUMBS UP
As elegant as Kajiya, but in a more natural way, is the majestic whooping crane with its slow but steady wing beat. Here's a ""must"" item for new Texans. Head on down to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge to see the whoopers' winter home. The first birds have swooped in from Canada and 300 are expected to follow. Google Texas Parks and whooping cranes.
THUMBS DOWN
It's taken the Astros half a decade to not suck. So why would we expect Stephen Colbert to be good a month into a new job? Get this: In a skit mocking our esteemed former governor's exit from the GOP primary, Colbert laid this egg: ""Citizens, last week the games lost a brave fighter in Rick Perry; I'd like to say he's gone to a better place, but he lives in Houston."" Sorry, Colbert, but this is war. Unless you crawl down here on your hands and knees begging for forgiveness, we will have NASA program every DVR in America to record Fallon or Kimmel.
THUMBS DOWN
No one who has crossed the editorial board threshold is as self-certain (viz. intransigent) as Ted Cruz. His logic, he trusts, is superior to all. But our Supreme Court lawyer had it wrong when he called out Pope Francis over the death penalty. ""I believe the death penalty is a recognition of the preciousness of human life, that for the most egregious crimes, the ultimate punishment should apply."" Would that argument fly with the Prince of Peace? We think not. Nor would it be embraced by the dozen men exonerated from Texas' death row for crimes they did not commit.
THUMBS DOWN
So where did the senator learn his logic? Maybe at home. Here's what Rafael Cruz, Ted's dad, had to say at a rally against the Houston equal rights ordinance this month: ""It is appalling that in a city like Houston, right in the middle of the Bible Belt, we had a homosexual mayor. Why? Because too many people have been sitting in their pews or sitting at home with this business about 'separation of church and state.' ""
THUMBS DOWN Lance Berkman, the retired Astros player, traveled North America to city after city with equal rights ordinances in place. None of those towns has seen the parade of horribles that fear-mongering opponents of Houston's ordinance preach. But they've enlisted the Rice grad to bellow the hollow party line on a radio ad.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,567,87.19,55.84,57.94,27.21,16.2,17.81,81.48,63.14,50.44,9.88,5.29,0.35,1.41,0.53,2.12,0.71,4.59,15.17,8.99,1.23,16.75,7.58,2.82,5.64,1.41,14.46,5.64,3.7,5.64,2.65,0.71,2.47,9.7,1.06,8.64,1.06,1.06,1.41,0.71,0.18,4.41,0,5.11,2.82,2.29,0.88,0.53,0.35,0,0.18,0,0,10.58,3,0.53,0,0.35,0.53,1.06,6.88,0.18,0,0.35,2.29,1.41,1.23,0,0.18,4.59,1.23,0.71,1.59,0.35,0.88,3.7,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.35,1.23,0.71,0.35,0.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.88,12.7,0.18,3,9.52,0.71,0,0,4.41,4.06,4.23,0.88,0,0,0,0,0,19.75,5.47,4.59,0.88,0,3.7,5.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.45,2.24,2.07,2.12,2.02,-2.44,-2.26,-1.75,-1.39,-1.69,1.06,0.35,0,0.18,1.06,0,0.71,0,0.53,0,0.88,0,0.35,0,0.35,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,2.26,1.24,18.02,123.46,0.71,194,-0.18,229.28,1.76,158.73,1.23,88.18,-0.53,264.55,1.06,423.28,0,141.09,-0.35,70.55,0.71,17.64,0,17.64,158.73,211.64,17.64,17.64,70.55,0.35,158.73,35.27,17.64,158.73,35.27,0.35,0,123.46,52.91,105.82,17.64,35.27,0,1.06,1,0,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
9/26/15,17,B,District F - Incumbent Councilman Richard A. Nguyen deserves a second term in office. ,"Houston is the nation's most diverse city, and incumbent Richard A. Nguyen, our choice for District F, serves what may be the most international district in town. Centered along the Westpark Tollway toward the city's far western edges and with a small portion in Fort Bend County, District F is home to large parts of Asia Town, especially Vietnamese communities, as well as a growing Hispanic base.
In a district where residents are immigrants or children of immigrants, Nguyen's life story is familiar. He was born in Saigon, Vietnam, and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1975, at age 11.
Nguyen spent 10 years working for the city's Solid Waste Management Department before pulling off the biggest political upset of 2013 when he vanquished two-term incumbent Council Member Al Hoag. Although he had no campaign war chest, he won his surprise victory fueled only by what he described as motivation and mission. Internecine feuds within the Vietnamese community also played a role.
A political neophyte when he stepped into office two years ago, Nguyen has supported Alief Independent School District's COMET program, an after-school program that works with children living in multi-family housing and has secured future bond funds for District F's first multi-service center. He's shown that he's responsive to the people in his district by directly funding overtime for Houston Police Department officers.
Opponent Steve Le is a physician specializing in family medicine. Although he offers an impressive resume, he's not that familiar with city issues, and his opposition to the Houston equal rights ordinance is a mark against him, particularly in the district he hopes to represent.
A third candidate, Rev. Kendall Baker filed on the last day. His primary issue is opposition to HERO, ironic perhaps, since he was suspended as a manager for the city's 311 customer service line after charges of sexual harassment against subordinate female employees were filed against him.
Nguyen, on the other hand, offered a passionate defense of the equal rights ordinance. (""We have nothing to lose but much to gain."") He spent his first term learning the ropes and working with the mayor in an effort to get things done for his district.

9/24/15,17,B,For District H - Karla Cisneros will work for smart development in changing neighborhoods. ,"
Houston is a city of great diversity, but also economic disparity and segregation, and all these challenges come into full play in District H. The L-shaped district covers the booming single-family neighborhoods of Near Northside and Woodland Heights, and the townhouse rows of the East End. It also covers economically troubled areas north of the 610 loop and industrial developments along Buffalo Bayou toward the Port of Houston. The population is 71 percent Hispanic and nearly half lack a high school diploma, yet the blocks along Navigation Boulevard were recently praised by the insistently hip Vice Media as the scene of Houston's musical golden age.
These conflicting images paint a picture of a district in transition, and it needs a city council member who is dedicated to harnessing growth to help old neighborhoods. Karla Cisneros is the woman for the job.
Cisneros, who will be 61 on Election Day, works as a teacher but resigned to run for office. She also served on the HISD board of education from 2000 to 2006, including a term as board president. She received her undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia and a Master's in Architecture from Rice University.
Cisneros told the editorial board that she thought the city's pensions were unsustainable, but that City Hall needed to honor its promises to employees. She also said that she supported the Houston equal rights ordinance.
However, perhaps more than any other candidate we've met during this cycle, Cisneros targeted economic disparity as the key problem facing Houston. This is the sort of thinking that you often hear from policy experts like Rice University's Dr. Stephen Klineberg, but not nearly enough from our elected officials. ""We're increasingly becoming a city of haves and have-nots,"" Cisneros told the editorial board. ""The city has a role, and I don't think they've played it very well in supporting the success of children, our families and our neighborhoods.""
While her goals are idealistic, Cisneros' policy solutions are strictly down-to-earth. She points to community involvement and communication at all levels to help encourage smart development that fits with neighborhoods. She also points to public-private partnerships as a way for new growth to help improve lives of long-time residents.
""Protect what's important and help people transition into this more-dense, more-urban city that Houston has become,"" she said.
Cisneros already has a record of using smart development to help neighborhoods. She led a grassroots effort in Woodland Heights to improve Travis Elementary, including building one of the first SPARK parks. That project helped make the school into the heart of the neighborhood.
Cisneros applies this policy of creating neighborhood cores to Metro, as well.
""One of the opportunities that I see in District H are the 12 Metro [rail] stations that are new,"" she told the editorial board. ""The stations themselves are nice, but they're not connected to the neighborhoods around them.""
Cisneros pointed to 380 agreements as a way to transform the stations into transit nodes and encourage economic development. ""We need to be smart about our development and preparing for the future.""
That smart vote would be for Cisneros.

9/24/15,17,B,TV ads slow in race for mayor ,"With midyear fundraising north of $7 million and a throng of top-tier candidates, Houston voters were expected to see a barrage of mayoral advertising across the airwaves come fall. Yet, the race is only now crawling onto television.
To date, five candidates have paid a combined $1.6 million to advertise on network television, half of what was spent on TV in the last open-seat race in 2009.
Instead, they are embracing other advertising methods and retail politics: door-knocking, community appearances and a seemingly endless slog of forums.
""The campaign's not about who's going to win the air war,"" University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said. ""It's about who's going to win the ground war.""
After nearly topping the July fundraising that put this year's mayor's race on track to be the most expensive in recent city history, City Councilman Stephen Costello led the pack to the TV airwaves in late August.
His debut ad focused on three broad policy priorities: infrastructure, public safety and city finances.
Thus far, Costello has spent more on broadcast than any candidate in the race - about $625,000 across KTRK (Channel 13), KHOU (Channel 11), KPRC (Channel 2,) KRIV (Channel 26) and KIAH (Channel 39), according to his campaign - with ads scheduled in two waves through Nov. 2. He also has been advertising on cable since July.
""We saw the opportunity now to break out early, and thanks to successful fundraising and low overhead, we're in a position to go back up and go back up strong,"" campaign manager Ward Curtin said.
Meanwhile, presumptive front-runners Sylvester Turner and Adrian Garcia, who closed out the first half of the year with more than $1 million in the bank apiece, have invested about $450,000 each in broadcast TV.
A Turner ad began airing this week on the same five Houston-area channels as Costello and briefly introduces the candidate and his policy initiatives: job training, a living wage, community policing, school partnerships and filling potholes.
According to his campaign, Turner also will begin advertising on cable on Oct. 12, having spent $75,000.
Garcia has opted for a more concentrated approach, with his ads slated to run only in the final three and a half weeks before the Nov. 2 election. They will air on six Houston-area channels, including Univision and Telemundo, beginning Oct. 10, according to campaign manager Mary Bell.
""The Garcia campaign is communicating to all voters, including predominantly Spanish speaking voters, and paid communication is a part of that,"" Bell said, adding, ""we're not finished buying.""
Even so, political observers characterized this year's mayoral presence on the television airwaves as moderate.
""I've been surprised we haven't seen more TV prior to this point, and more spent on TV for the coming weeks,"" local political analyst Nancy Sims said. In 2009, the top four finishers spent a combined $3.2 million on television advertising by late October, with former City Councilman Peter Brown putting up more than $1.8 million, then-City Controller Annise Parker about $758,000 and former City Attorney Gene Locke about $630,00.
The fourth candidate, former Harris County Department of Education trustee Roy Morales, stayed off TV.
Rounding out this year's broadcast presence are former Kemah Mayor Bill King and former Congressman Chris Bell.
Federal Communications Commission records show King has spent nearly $20,000 for time on KHOU next week, though campaign spokesman Chris Begala said King also will be going up on three other channels.
""Our intention is to stay up on broadcast until Election Day, but it would not be a deal-killer to be off a day or three,"" Begala said in an email. ""We are engaged in an aggressive mail program, social media, cable and radio buy.""
King has spent nearly $300,000 on cable, beginning in May, according to his campaign.
Chris Bell also has made a nominal foray onto television, spending nearly $25,000 to run a 30-second introductory spot this week on KTRK, KHOU, KPRC and KIAH, according to his campaign.
In addition to mentioning some of his campaign priorities, Bell's ad vaguely alludes to other candidates' records by claiming that Bell has ""no scandals, no baggage, just an honest plan.""
However, no one's television ad directly attacks another candidate.
""There's a kind of staidness to the race - almost boringness to the race - that doesn't lend itself to broadcast TV drama,"" Rottinghaus said.
Former City Attorney Ben Hall plans to spend at least $250,000 on broadcast ""at the appropriate time,"" according to campaign spokesman Wayne Dolcefino.
Businessman Marty McVey said he does not plan to take his campaign to network TV, though he said he has released ads on a Vietnamese channel.
""I want to engage places that other candidates don't work,"" McVey said.
With early voting beginning in less than a month, he and others are continuing to shop their messages to voters face-to-face.
""It's going to be a battle over coalition politics, making sure you get your voters out,"" Rottinghaus said.
Mayor's race aside, Texans for Local Control, a group advocating for local control of municipal pensions, launched more than $120,000 in television ads this week on KHOU and KIAH, FCC records show.
Houston Unites, a campaign supporting the city's embattled equal rights ordinance, will debut an ad on broadcast networks Thursday, according to the campaign, which has spent $400,000 to run it over the next several weeks.",Houston Unites,1,888,90.85,48.76,47.62,24.54,21.66,25.79,76.24,54.73,42.57,5.86,3.38,0.23,0.68,0.23,1.58,0.34,2.48,13.4,6.19,4.95,15.65,5.29,3.72,4.84,1.13,11.49,5.74,6.31,7.09,1.35,1.24,4.5,8.22,0.56,7.09,0.79,0.68,0.34,1.24,0,3.72,0,1.91,1.01,0.68,0.34,0,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,11.26,5.07,0.34,0.11,0.34,0.23,2.48,5.63,0,0,0,2.25,6.31,4.17,0.11,2.03,6.31,1.69,0,2.59,2.59,0,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0.34,0,0,0,0.45,0.11,0.23,3.27,9.57,0.45,1.69,7.21,0.79,0,0,6.08,4.62,3.27,1.8,0,0,0,0,0,24.55,4.95,9.35,0,0,2.36,7.88,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,2.33,2.42,2.41,2.42,1.86,-2.29,-0.68,-0.19,-0.74,-1.29,0.23,0.45,0.11,0.11,0.34,0,0.79,0,0.68,0,0.11,0,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,1.25,0.76,14.56,157.84,0.9,180.38,-0.23,90.19,0.56,202.93,2.03,33.82,-0.34,326.94,0.68,372.04,0,214.21,-0.34,33.82,0.34,0,0,67.64,124.01,11.27,0,11.27,56.37,0,56.37,22.55,90.19,11.27,11.27,0.11,0,33.82,11.27,78.92,0,33.82,0,0.34,1,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,1

Fake IDs
Regarding ""Fake-ID arrest at clinic creates furor"" (Page A1, Friday), what is the problem with a person being confronted by police for fake ID? I have to provide an ID every time I check in for medical services to prove I'm a legitimate claimant. The hospital shouldn't have to apologize. These are safety measures to prevent false claims.
Let the activists pay for this person's claims if they're so concerned about immigrants.
Alisa Slack, Houston
Ben Carson
Regarding ""Carson: A Muslim 'absolutely' should not be president"" (A2, Monday), unless Dr. Ben Carson is intent on amending the U.S. Constitution, he has made a gargantuan error in his campaign.
Regardless of how he feels about Muslims, he cannot advocate that a Muslim not be president of the United States. The Constitution clearly forbids any religious test for public office. Proponents of Carson will argue that he was only expressing his personal opinion, not exercising political advocacy. This may be true.
But still, it was a distasteful thing to say, leaving him very vulnerable to his political opponents. I think Carson has destroyed his chances for the Republican nomination.
John L. Indo, Houston Equal rights
Regarding ""Be Hero-ic"" (Page B15, Sunday), what seems to be overlooked is the fact that the Houston equal rights ordinance is in many ways superfluous as federal protections are already in place.
The editorial suggests that unless this ordinance passes, Houston could suffer in revenue from outside businesses and events. It's extremely doubtful that it would have that big of an impact, but even if that were true, that does not mean Houston should be bullied to push through a problematic and unpopular ordinance for the sake of money.
Jessica Lewis, Spring JPs at work
""Two Harris County JPs resume weddings"" (Page B2, Friday), now that the JPs have chosen to resume the provision of matrimonial services, it seems it is not because of civic duty but simply the desire to get paid for a service that is theirs to provide as a result of holding an elected position.
Only in the world of government would an arrangement like this be allowed. B. Dee Davis Jr., Houston Halcyon days
Regarding ""Reuniting with those who knew us when"" (Page B9, Sept. 21), Ruben Navarrette's column resonates with me. A decade and a half older than Navarette, I am more nostalgic than he recalling fondly acquaintances and friends from high school, that ""special category all its own"" and college in Houston and Austin.
As I listen to music or read historical accounts or, even better, see classmates that stir recollections of my school years in the '60s and '70s, I invariably smile and experience a warming in my heart calling to mind that tune ""The Way We Were"" sung by Barbra Streisand.
Bill Spear Bartlett, Houston Winning performances
Regarding ""Chamber Choir leader looks back on 20 years"" (Page E4, Friday), it's an incredible organization. Houston should be very proud to have the Houston Chamber Choir!
Wayne Ashley, posted on HoustonChronicle.com Kelsey-Seybold
Regarding ""Groups pay physicians to keep patients healthy and save money"" (Page D1, Sunday), since 1949, Houston has been home to one of the most successful Accountable Care Organizations in the Nation, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic. In 2012, Kelsey-Seybold received accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance as the first (and still only) Houston-based Accountable Care Organization. More recently, our model of care has helped the city of Houston save more than $42 million over three years.
Accountable Care Organizations are not limited to groups engaged in shared savings programs with Medicare. Rather, some of the most successful ACOs are those which implement a standard of care across the board for all patients, not just the elderly. We all deserve an organization that will monitor for health trends and implement actions to improve outcomes, eliminate medical waste like unnecessary diagnostics or duplicate tests, and reward physicians for the quality of care they provide to patients, not the quantity of patients they see.
Our hope is that eventually, all employers engage with an Accountable Care Organization for their health care needs - we have found that employers who do implement an ACO plan see savings of anywhere between 10-20 percent and a higher member satisfaction rate among their employees.
Spencer Berthelsen, chairman and managing director Kelsey-Seybold Clinic Figuring out Trump
Regarding ""Bush targets Trump on immigrant issues"" (Page B2, Tuesday), it has taken a while, but I think I have figured out Donald Trump and his quest to be president. Remember Sarah Palin and her run for vice president? After her loss, she returned to Alaska to continue to be governor. It did not take her long to realize her popularity on the lecture tour and the amount of money she could make talking about things that she could not nor should not speak about during a run for office. Her resignation allowed her to tour and not have political responsibility for her words.
Money speaks louder than words, especially if someone does not have to be elected to anything or have to be responsible for their opinions.
David Moss, Kingwood Texans and reality Regarding ""Mallett under increasing pressure"" (HoustonChronicle.com, Sunday), I think that as fans we need to give our expectations a reality check - this is not a Super Bowl team, neither a playoff one; this team is a work in progress. And having no consistent QB is like a ship without a compass.
Let's support them and hope they finish this season at least 9-7.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,920,70.22,44.56,10.46,46.5,22.44,25.76,82.93,60.98,48.7,10.87,6.09,1.63,0.98,0,2.28,0.98,4.78,14.24,6.52,2.5,13.48,8.04,3.15,5.43,2.07,14.46,5.98,4.02,6.2,1.74,1.41,2.93,13.48,0.65,12.72,2.5,1.41,2.07,2.07,0.76,4.24,0.43,4.24,2.83,1.09,1.41,0.65,0.33,0,0.11,0,0,13.26,5.33,1.41,0.98,0.11,0.54,0.76,7.72,0.11,0.33,1.09,1.3,2.61,2.28,0.54,0,5.43,0.43,0.11,3.8,0.87,0.43,1.85,1.74,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0.87,0.33,0.43,0.33,0.11,0,0.43,0.65,0.11,4.24,5.43,0.43,0.76,3.26,0.43,0.54,0.22,3.15,2.39,4.89,1.52,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,18.37,4.78,5.87,0.22,0.11,1.3,6.09,0,1.41,0,0,0,0.43,3.07,3.23,2.74,2.82,2.45,-1.21,0.61,0.97,0.54,-0.2,0.22,0.54,2.07,0.33,0.43,0,1.09,0,1.41,0,0.11,0.11,1.2,0.65,0.22,0,0,0.11,0,0,0.11,0,0,0,2.16,1.27,18.96,217.39,1.52,456.52,2.17,195.65,1.52,141.3,0.76,206.52,-1.2,239.13,1.3,489.13,0,76.09,0.22,32.61,0.33,10.87,0,43.48,86.96,173.91,0,10.87,76.09,0,173.91,54.35,0,32.61,21.74,0.22,0,108.7,10.87,163.04,10.87,10.87,0,0.76,1,0,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,1

9/20/15,17,B,"For At-large 1 - Tom McCasland has a proven record of cutting waste, fixing broken government. ","When government is broken, who do you hire to fix it? For the Harris County Housing Authority, the answer was Tom McCasland. Plenty of candidates can tout their ideas for repairing Houston's problems, but only McCasland has a record of working within government to cut fat, root out corruption and balance budgets. In the race to replace a term-limited Steven Costello for the City Council At-Large 1 seat, voters should send McCasland to City Hall so he can put his skills to work.
McCasland, 42, has a biography that reads like a Horatio Alger story. The child of missionaries, he grew up next to a Navajo reservation in a home that he shared with his nine siblings - no electricity and no running water. From these modest beginnings he ascended to Baylor University for a master's degree in philosophy, Yale Law School and a job at Vinson & Elkins. McCasland stepped into the public eye, however, when he was appointed to head up the troubled county housing authority after a Chronicle investigation revealed that the agency had wasted millions of dollars on unnecessary expenditures, including statues, parties and executive pay.
As CEO, McCasland cut the operations budget while increasing services to the needy and even giving his lowest-paid employees a much-needed raise. Essentially, he took a slush-fund and successfully rededicated it to its true purpose: helping the poor and homeless find safe places to live. This focus on core services is a philosophy that voters should want to see in City Hall.
It is a philosophy that becomes apparent when McCasland discusses his goals if elected. When he met with the Chronicle editorial board, he said that he wanted to follow the same model he set at the housing authority by specifically scrutinizing the city's largest budgetary items and figuring out how to reduce costs.
""One of the largest items in a lot of these entities are middle-level management that aren't doing the job,"" he said. Instead, he would refocus resources on front-line employees.
McCasland also pointed to unnecessary arrests for low-level marijuana possession as low hanging fruit where the city could easily save money.
""Just the booking fees alone, we're paying $8 million a year,"" McCasland said, referring to regional statistics. ""That $8 million would be much better spent focused on our violent crimes and our serious property crimes.""
On pensions, McCasland says that he won't vote for any deal that doesn't cover each year's incurred costs and doesn't put the city on a path to paying down our liabilities. He also wants more transparency and stricter timelines on tax increment reinvestment zones, and supports the Houston equal rights ordinance.
In this field of seven candidates, former police officer Mike Knox and Harris County Democratic Party Chair Lane Lewis also stand out. However, voters should be wary of Chris Oliver, a Houston Community College trustee, who voted for a contract with a major vendor without disclosing it had hired his own company as a subcontractor. He has since apologized for what he calls an ""honest mistake,"" but there's little room for mistakes in this crowded race for At-Large 1.
Among all those candidates, McCasland has a proven record of going above and beyond the call of duty in office and deserves voters' support in this election.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,545,82.88,68.95,3.19,24.93,22.71,26.61,81.47,60,47.16,9.54,5.32,0,0.73,0.18,3.85,0.18,4.22,15.6,8.07,2.02,14.5,5.5,4.22,6.24,1.1,11.56,5.69,4.4,6.24,2.02,1.1,3.12,8.62,0.55,8.07,1.83,0.55,2.57,0.37,0.37,2.02,0,3.67,2.02,1.65,0.37,0,0.37,0.18,0.18,0,0,11.74,3.85,0.55,0.18,0,0.73,1.65,7.16,0.18,0,0,3.85,3.3,3.12,0,0.18,8.99,0.37,0.92,5.14,2.57,0.18,1.1,0.18,0,0,0,0.18,0,0.18,0,0.18,0.55,0.18,0.18,0.18,0,0.37,0.55,0,3.12,9.91,0.73,1.1,6.97,0.92,0,0,2.39,3.3,3.85,0.55,0,0,0,0,0,15.78,4.22,5.32,0.18,0,2.02,4.04,0,0.55,0,0.18,0,0,3.43,3.7,3.02,3.14,2.86,-2.13,-0.9,-0.36,-1.16,-1.5,0,0.92,0.73,0.37,0.73,0,0.37,0,1.28,0,0,0.37,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.48,1.16,16.45,128.44,0.55,311.93,1.28,91.74,0.92,256.88,0.73,91.74,-0.55,366.97,-0.92,550.46,0,55.05,0,18.35,0.18,18.35,0,36.7,165.14,91.74,36.7,0,18.35,0,146.79,110.09,36.7,73.39,18.35,0.18,0,128.44,73.39,73.39,0,36.7,18.35,0.55,1,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,1
9/20/15,17,B,"Be HERO-ic - For opponents of the rights ordinance, facts are irrelevant and their claims are absurd. ","Let's be frank: The organized opposition to Houston's proposed equal rights ordinance is mendacious, deceitful and irresponsible in the extreme. Attorney Jared Woodfill and his opposition cohorts know that nothing in the ordinance - repeat, nothing - allows male sexual predators dressed in drag to lurk in women's restrooms waiting to attack women and little girls. If they don't know, then they haven't read the ordinance.
And if any city or county across the country, including Texas, has had a dangerous incident with transgender individuals making women uncomfortable by barging into the wrong bathroom, we haven't heard about it. The opponents know they cannot come up with reports of transgender women assaulting anyone in public bathrooms after the passage of anti-discrimination ordinances. They don't exist.
States as diverse as Iowa, Hawaii, Maine and New Mexico, 17 in all, report no evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the Houston opponents are predicting. Fort Worth was the first Texas city to pass a nondiscrimination ordinance, 15 years ago. Neither Fort Worth nor any other Texas city has reported problems.
As Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle: ""Nothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is - and always will be - illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people."" And as Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg pointed out recently, if sexual predators ""wanted to attack you in a public bathroom, they wouldn't need a city ordinance to do it.""
For ordinance opponents, facts are irrelevant. They're using what they consider their most effective tool to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits a group of people whose lifestyle they don't support. That's their real motive. They know that their best hope is to prey on parents' concerns about the safety of their children and to gin up always lurking discrimination against gays and the transgendered. To be blunt, they're playing their fellow Houstonians for chumps.
Reasonable minds can differ on any and all public policy issues, including the need for an equal rights ordinance, but Houstonians should insist that the debate be fair and that it focus on the facts. The fact is, Houston's law provides local protection for all Houstonians. It bans discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, sexual orientation or gender status. And, yes, business owners can still bar people from using a men's or women's restroom if they feel the person isn't of that gender.
Black ministers in Houston have been particularly outspoken against the ordinance, and, by all accounts, they've been highly effective. Their parishioners and congregants need to show a little independence. They need to read the ordinance themselves, consider the experience of other cities and apply a little common sense to the issue.
Here's another fact that opponents prefer to ignore: If it gets repealed, potential new residents, expanding businesses, major sporting events, tourists and convention planners are likely to look askance at a city that seems to bridle at protecting all its people from discrimination. That's why the Greater Houston Partnership, the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston released a joint statement last week supporting the ordinance.
""The perception we have built is that Houston is diverse and welcoming, and people around the country are believing that, and along comes an issue that would lead people to believe we're where we were 20 or 30 years ago,"" Partnership President Bob Harvey told the Chronicle last week.
Harvey and other Houston business leaders are well aware of what happened in Indiana, where a so-called ""religious freedom law"" appeared to be a thinly veiled attempt to sanction discrimination. Companies and conventions canceled events planned in the state, and the NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, publicly opposed the original version of the law as the city was set to host the Final Four.
Houston, too, is hosting the Final Four in a few months. Dan Gavitt, the NCAA's vice president of basketball championships, told the Chronicle a few days ago that the outcome of the ordinance vote won't affect next spring's event, but ""we'll monitor it very closely. It could have an impact on future Final Fours, because there are other options.""
We appreciate the need for debate, even though we strongly believe that Houston needs an equal rights ordinance. What we don't need is a nasty, cynical campaign playing on voters' fear and ignorance. This great city is bigger than that.
The equal rights ordinance is Propostion One on the November ballot.

9/18/15,17,A,Business groups support HERO - They fear repeal of rights law could hurt city economy ,"Read more about HERO at HoustonChronicle.com/equalrights
Three major local business and hospitality groups are warning voters that the city's economy could take a hit if Houston's embattled equal rights ordinance is repealed in November, boosting supporters' attempts to cast the law as not only a moral issue but also a practical one.
The Greater Houston Partnership, Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau and Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston released a joint statement Thursday backing the ordinance and calling Houston ""a diverse and welcoming city.""
""Discrimination of any kind is not a Houston value; it's bad for the people of our city and it's bad for our economy,"" the statement read.
A heated legal battle between opponents and the city ended with a Texas Supreme Court decision in late July ordering City Council to repeal the law or vote to affirm it and place on the November ballot. By a 12-5 vote, City Council opted to put the ordinance before voters in November.
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for opponents, pushed back against the idea that business would suffer if the law is repealed. Critics have homed in on the protections the law extends to transgender residents, arguing it would allow male sexual predators dressed in drag to enter women's restrooms. That and the possibility of litigation under the ordinance would discourage businesses from opening up shop in Houston, Woodfill said.
""The Partnership is taking the position, which I don't think is held by the people,"" Woodfill said. ""Which is that, if we prevent boys from going to girls' locker rooms, somehow people are going to stop going to Houston. That's outrageous and preposterous. What they're hoping that you will do is back down on your deeply held beliefs.""
Supporters of the law increasingly have pointed to Indiana, where a so-called ""religious freedom law"" drew national criticism last spring. Opponents called the law a thinly veiled attempt to allow discrimination, prompting companies and conventions to cancel events planned in the state. The NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, publicly opposed the original version of the law as the city was set to host the Final Four. Amid mounting pressure, the state legislature eventually passed an amended version of the bill intended to ease concerns about discrimination against gays and lesbians.
Houston's law bans discrimination based on a series of classes, including sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, sexual orientation and gender identity.
Though the Partnership originally expressed reservations about early drafts of the law, it eventually publicly supported the ordinance before City Council passed it 11-6 last year. A.J. Mistretta, a spokesman for the Visitors Bureau, said Partnership President Bob Harvey encouraged the group to issue the joint statement.
Houston Unites campaign manager Richard Carlbom said the groups' support demonstrates a desire in the business community to remain competitive with other large cities that already have similar nondiscrimination policies in place.
""If this gets repealed, I think a lot of folks will look at Houston and wonder if they should send employees here or hold conferences here,"" Carlbom said. ""They will wonder whether or not there are the appropriate protections in place.""
The argument is not new. Mayor Annise Parker and other officials long have warned that Houston's selection to host the 2017 Super Bowl and the 2016 NCAA Final Four, for instance, could be in jeopardy if the law is repealed.
""Houston simply isn't the City it was 20 or 30 years ago,"" Parker said last month. ""It is this open and inclusive atmosphere that helps make Houston attractive to new residents, new business, major sporting events like the Super Bowl and more. The ongoing effort by this group threatens to hurt that image and our progress.""
Carlbom and Woodfill said their campaigns will continue to talk about the potential business ramifications of the law as the November election approaches. The dueling campaigns already have hit the radio airwaves with a combined $300,000 in ads.
""It's going to be a close election,"" Carlbom said. ""The community is divided on this.""",Houston Unites,1,686,90.67,43.49,42.34,13.92,21.44,29.74,80.9,55.25,42.86,5.54,1.75,0.29,0.58,0.29,0,0.58,3.79,14.43,10.2,1.6,12.39,5.98,2.92,6.41,0.87,12.83,5.54,2.48,8.6,2.33,0.58,5.83,9.04,0,9.04,1.31,1.31,1.17,2.62,0.15,4.52,0,4.81,2.04,2.62,1.31,0.15,1.02,0,0.29,0.15,0,12.54,6.56,1.46,0.15,1.6,0.44,2.33,5.39,0.29,0,0.44,0.87,3.06,2.92,0.15,0,4.08,0.73,0.44,2.04,1.31,0.44,1.31,0.29,0,0.15,0,0,0.87,0,0,0,0.29,0.44,0,0,0,0,0.87,0.29,3.94,8.16,0.44,1.02,6.12,0.44,0,0.29,4.96,3.35,3.64,2.62,0,0,0,0,0,17.2,4.96,5.98,0,0,2.19,4.08,0,0.44,0,0.15,0,0.44,3.89,4.11,3.75,4.15,3.21,-3.55,-2.14,-0.6,-0.18,-1.64,0.29,0.73,0.29,0.44,2.04,0.58,1.31,0,0.44,0,0.29,0.29,2.33,0.15,0.58,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0.15,0,0.29,1.93,1.41,18.96,306.12,2.48,247.81,-0.44,160.35,1.31,204.08,2.04,145.77,-1.17,233.24,0.58,481.05,0,160.35,-0.58,29.15,0.29,14.58,0,14.58,174.93,145.77,43.73,14.58,58.31,0.15,131.2,116.62,14.58,58.31,14.58,0.15,0,102.04,174.93,116.62,29.15,0,14.58,1.75,1,0.58,1.6,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.58,0,0.15,0,1

9/15/15,17,Texas Opinion,TEXAS VIEW: Bathroom wars are getting crazy ,"
Texans who grew up in Dallas and San Antonio are probably familiar with the Magic Time Machine, a chain of restaurants known more for their manufactured mayhem than for the quality of their food. They‚Äôll likely recall that when they needed to go to the restroom, a waiter took them by the hand and led them through the dining room, all the while shouting ‚ÄúPotty patrol! Potty patrol!‚Äù Laughter invariably ensued.
If we believed that Jared Woodfill, the former head of the Harris County Republican Party, and his fellow opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) were truly concerned about the likelihood of transgender ogres lurking in public restrooms, as they claim in their over-the-top radio ads, we would suggest that Houston restaurants be required to offer a potty patrol service. Of if that‚Äôs too gauche for this sophisticated trans city ‚Äî transnational we mean ‚Äî may we suggest, a la Paris, Rome and London, the required presence of restroom attendants, individuals paid to spend their working hours in public restrooms, with a saucer near the wash basin where patrons deposit tips.
The fact is, Woodfill and company are not concerned that men dressing up as women are just waiting for HERO to pass ‚Äî and, we presume, for the annual women‚Äôs apparel sale at Nordstrom ‚Äî so they can don skirts, blouses and high heels and assault women and girls in public bathrooms. Their aim is to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits gay and transgendered Houstonians, people whose lives they can‚Äôt accept. If they can stir up the general public with scare tactics that border on the absurd, then so be it; they will have saved Houstonians from surrendering to the creeping acceptance of what they believe to be a deviant lifestyle. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, and anyone persuaded by their cynical ploy should be too.
The so-called HERO measure on the November ballot is designed to protect people against discrimination in employment, housing and other sectors. HERO protects gay and transgender people but also bans discrimination based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information. It also bans discrimination based on family, marital or military status. Woodfill and friends focus on the bathroom menace because they calculate that it borders on legitimate concerns about sexual predators and thus will spill over.
‚ÄúNothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is ‚Äî and always will be ‚Äî illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people,‚Äù Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle.
In addition, none of the states and municipalities that have had anti-discrimination ordinances for years reports any evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the Houston opponents are predicting. Minnesota, for example, began prohibiting discrimination against transgender people more than 20 years ago. A Minneapolis police spokesman told Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg that sexual assaults from the 1993 law were ‚Äúnot even remotely‚Äù a problem, and that a police department inquiry found ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in the way of such crimes in the city. Iowa, New Mexico, Maine and Hawaii are among more than a dozen jurisdictions that also report no problems.
Whether Houston needs an anti-discrimination ordinance has been and continues to be a legitimate topic for citizens to debate. We happen to believe it will be good for Houston; others argue that it‚Äôs superfluous, that protections for some groups already are extended by federal law.

9/15/15,17,Texas Opinion,TEXAS VIEW: Bathroom wars are getting crazy ,"
Texans who grew up in Dallas and San Antonio are probably familiar with the Magic Time Machine, a chain of restaurants known more for their manufactured mayhem than for the quality of their food. They‚Äôll likely recall that when they needed to go to the restroom, a waiter took them by the hand and led them through the dining room, all the while shouting ‚ÄúPotty patrol! Potty patrol!‚Äù Laughter invariably ensued.
If we believed that Jared Woodfill, the former head of the Harris County Republican Party, and his fellow opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) were truly concerned about the likelihood of transgender ogres lurking in public restrooms, as they claim in their over-the-top radio ads, we would suggest that Houston restaurants be required to offer a potty patrol service. Of if that‚Äôs too gauche for this sophisticated trans city ‚Äî transnational we mean ‚Äî may we suggest, a la Paris, Rome and London, the required presence of restroom attendants, individuals paid to spend their working hours in public restrooms, with a saucer near the wash basin where patrons deposit tips.
The fact is, Woodfill and company are not concerned that men dressing up as women are just waiting for HERO to pass ‚Äî and, we presume, for the annual women‚Äôs apparel sale at Nordstrom ‚Äî so they can don skirts, blouses and high heels and assault women and girls in public bathrooms. Their aim is to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits gay and transgendered Houstonians, people whose lives they can‚Äôt accept. If they can stir up the general public with scare tactics that border on the absurd, then so be it; they will have saved Houstonians from surrendering to the creeping acceptance of what they believe to be a deviant lifestyle. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, and anyone persuaded by their cynical ploy should be too.
The so-called HERO measure on the November ballot is designed to protect people against discrimination in employment, housing and other sectors. HERO protects gay and transgender people but also bans discrimination based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information. It also bans discrimination based on family, marital or military status. Woodfill and friends focus on the bathroom menace because they calculate that it borders on legitimate concerns about sexual predators and thus will spill over.
‚ÄúNothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is ‚Äî and always will be ‚Äî illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people,‚Äù Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle.
In addition, none of the states and municipalities that have had anti-discrimination ordinances for years reports any evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the Houston opponents are predicting. Minnesota, for example, began prohibiting discrimination against transgender people more than 20 years ago. A Minneapolis police spokesman told Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg that sexual assaults from the 1993 law were ‚Äúnot even remotely‚Äù a problem, and that a police department inquiry found ‚Äúnothing‚Äù in the way of such crimes in the city. Iowa, New Mexico, Maine and Hawaii are among more than a dozen jurisdictions that also report no problems.
Whether Houston needs an anti-discrimination ordinance has been and continues to be a legitimate topic for citizens to debate. We happen to believe it will be good for Houston; others argue that it‚Äôs superfluous, that protections for some groups already are extended by federal law. Those polar perspectives represent an argument worth having, whereas the bathroom bogeyman claim is beneath the dignity of this great city. We really don‚Äôt need Woodfill and his anti-HERO pals playing potty patrol for us.",Houston Unites,1,610,75.69,71.34,18.98,22.27,26.52,27.38,81.97,59.02,48.85,9.84,5.08,0,1.31,0,0.33,3.11,4.75,14.1,7.7,0.49,13.77,6.89,3.44,7.38,1.31,11.8,4.59,2.79,6.72,1.97,0.33,4.43,12.95,0.98,11.31,2.13,1.15,1.48,1.97,0.82,3.93,0.16,5.74,2.79,2.62,1.48,0.33,0.82,0.33,0.33,0,0,14.59,5.41,0,0,1.8,1.15,1.97,9.34,0.16,0.33,0.66,0.82,1.48,1.15,0.16,0.16,3.93,0.66,0.49,1.64,0.98,0.16,3.11,0.33,0,0,0,0,0.98,0.66,0,0.82,0,0.49,0,0,0,0.16,0.82,0,2.79,5.9,0.16,0.66,4.92,0.16,0.16,0,3.44,3.11,3.44,1.15,0,0,0,0,0,14.1,3.44,6.23,0,0.33,0.98,3.11,0,0.66,0.33,0.16,0,0.16,3.36,3.45,2.96,2.7,2.77,-2.51,-1.35,-0.46,-1.02,-1.88,0.16,0.16,0.16,0.82,0.98,0.66,0.98,0,0.66,0.16,0.49,0.49,0.98,0.16,0.49,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,2.2,1.39,15.92,114.75,0.16,393.44,-0.33,81.97,0.49,147.54,1.48,65.57,-0.66,196.72,-0.49,409.84,0,65.57,0,81.97,0.82,32.79,0,65.57,131.15,147.54,16.39,32.79,81.97,0.33,163.93,65.57,16.39,0,0,0,0,114.75,32.79,229.51,98.36,16.39,0,1.31,1,0.64,0.96,0,0,0.16,0,0.32,0,0.64,0.32,0.64,0,1

9/13/15,17,Editorials ,Area Opinions: Message needed after attack on ref - Message needed after attack on ref ,"Message needed after attack on ref
The blatant, blindside attack of a game referee waged by two San Antonio Jay high school football players last week deserves a much stronger reaction of outrage and condemnation than what San Antonio-area school officials have offered so far. Suspension of the two players was an obvious first reaction. Criminal prosecution remains an option.
But we believe the entire team's season suspension and the head coach's dismissal would send an unequivocal message to all Texas high school football players: Such egregious misconduct carries the strongest possible consequences.
Last week's attack occurred in the final moments of John Jay's away game against Marble Falls High School, which Jay lost 15-9. From the looks of what happened, the two players who attacked referee Robert Watts were sending their personal message of disapproval over officiating decisions leading up to their loss. As if that somehow justified what they did.
The bad sportsmanship by John Jay players suggest they're not getting the right message from the adults coaching them. This entire team's culture needs to be rewired, from head coach Gary Gutierrez on down.
The John Jay Mustangs need to take the rest of the season off so that cooler heads can prevail the next time players suit up. Dallas

Scare tactics over ordinance undignified
If we believed Jared Woodfill, the former head of the Harris County Republican Party, and his fellow opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance were truly concerned about the likelihood of transgender ogres lurking in public restrooms, as they claim in their over-the-top radio ads, we would suggest Houston restaurants be required to offer potty police.
The fact is, Woodfill and company are not concerned that men dressing up as women are just waiting for HERO to pass ‚Äî and, we presume, for the annual women's apparel sale at Nordstrom ‚Äî so they can don skirts, blouses and high heels and assault women and girls in public bathrooms. Their aim is to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits gay and transgendered Houstonians, people whose lives they can't accept.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,345,89.52,68.81,11.82,3.41,26.54,28.7,80,54.2,41.16,7.54,4.93,0,1.16,0,0.29,2.9,2.61,12.75,7.83,1.45,13.33,4.93,2.03,5.8,0.87,9.86,6.96,4.06,7.83,2.32,0.58,5.22,11.01,0.29,10.72,1.45,1.16,2.61,1.74,0.58,3.77,0,6.38,1.74,4.06,1.74,0,1.16,0.29,0.29,0,0,15.07,6.96,0.87,0,1.45,1.45,2.03,8.41,0,0,1.16,0.58,0.29,0.29,0,0,4.93,2.03,0,2.32,0.58,0,3.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,1.16,0,0.87,0,0,0,0.29,0.58,0,2.32,6.09,0,0.87,4.35,0.58,0,0.29,4.06,2.9,3.48,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.3,3.77,3.77,0,0,2.32,1.45,0,0.58,0,0,0,0,3.6,3.32,3.09,3.03,2.79,-3.67,-2.59,-1.63,-2.22,-3.36,0.29,0,0.29,1.45,1.74,0,0.58,0,0.29,0,0,0,0.58,0.87,0.29,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.97,2.53,13.47,86.96,-0.29,463.77,-1.16,173.91,0.87,57.97,0.58,86.96,-0.87,376.81,0,376.81,0,202.9,1.16,28.99,0.29,57.97,0,28.99,28.99,173.91,0,57.97,0,0,173.91,115.94,0,28.99,0,0,0,0,0,86.96,57.97,0,0,1.45,1,0,0.58,0,0,0.29,0,0,0,0,0.29,0.29,0,1

9/9/15,17,News,Recent editorials from Texas newspapers ,"Abbott, Paxton don't own the government
Texans, being suspicious of government, have a fine tradition of demanding and receiving open government. It's why the state has open meetings and public information laws. It's a tradition that Gov. Greg Abbott, when he was the attorney general, defended.
Unfortunately, Abbott in his current position and Attorney General Ken Paxton in Abbott's former position are failing in their responsibility to promote and defend open government.
Last month, Paxton requested that cameras not be allowed when the felony financial fraud case against him goes to trial. Why Texas has an attorney general who is a criminal defendant is a whole 'nother long, sad story of voter malpractice we've told before. Before the 2014 primary he already had admitted to failing to register as a financial representative and failing to inform people to whom he had recommended investments that his referrals earned him commissions. That admitted behavior should have been weaselly enough for voters to disqualify him.
But that's not our topic today. It's just incidental background that got us to the point where now Texas has an attorney general under criminal indictment for alleged transgressions wholly unrelated to him being a political candidate or officeholder. Today's topic is that the officeholder tasked with upholding Texas' fine tradition of open government is trying to circumvent it in spirit ‚Äî for his own personal ends.
We have a situation in which the glare of the camera would be good for open government but embarrassing to Paxton. A case as high-profile as a criminal trial brought against the state's attorney general deserves all the public scrutiny that can be mustered. Paxton's attempt to un-muster it is a clear conflict of interest ‚Äî doing what's bad for the people but good for him. He should resign or at least take an unpaid leave.
Abbott's lack of transparency has to do with an open records request by The Texas Tribune for email exchanges regarding public health policy. The Tribune obtained the emails ‚Äî but from another party, the Health and Human Services Commission. The emails should have come from Abbott for several reasons: because he initiated the exchanges, because as the former attorney general he should know and appreciate the public information law as well as anyone, and because as the state's top official he should set a good example.
Abbott started the correspondence in reaction to a Houston Chronicle opinion column about the state's continued mean-spirited, politically motivated, financially bone-headed refusal to accept billions of federal Medicaid expansion dollars provided under Obamacare. The adjectives are ours, not the column author's.
The author, Ken Janda, CEO of nonprofit insurer Community Health Choice, pointed out that Texas' health care safety net was ""in serious danger of meltdown"" because of the Medicaid refusal decision. Abbott defended Texas' right of refusal in court with partisan zeal as attorney general and maintains it as a policy decision as governor.
Abbott informed aides by email that he wanted to ""see the financials"" of Janda's nonprofit and that it was his understanding that large public hospitals such as those served by Community Health Choice are ""rolling in dough,"" according to the Tribune.
It smacks of petulant retaliation on Abbott's part. It looks like he was using his power to pursue a vendetta. That is not the purpose of the power voters gave him. The emails are an embarrassment. But, just like Paxton and his move to block cameras from his trial, that's beside the point. The people have a right to see their government in action.

The Dallas Morning News. Sept. 8, 2015.
After high school football players attack official, time to send a message
The blatant, blindside attack of a game referee waged by two John Jay High School football players last week deserves a much stronger reaction of outrage and condemnation than what San Antonio-area school officials have offered so far. Suspension of the two players was an obvious first reaction. Criminal prosecution remains an option.
But we believe the entire team's season suspension and the head coach's dismissal would send an unequivocal message to all Texas high school football players: Such egregious misconduct carries the strongest possible consequences.
Last week's attack occurred in the final moments of John Jay's away game against Marble Falls High School, which Jay lost 15-9. From the looks of what happened, the two players who attacked referee Robert Watts were sending their personal message of disapproval over officiating decisions leading up to their loss. As if that somehow justified what they did.
Unconfirmed reports indicate that Jay players were upset after allegedly overhearing racial slurs earlier in the game, which some attributed to Watts. A Jay player was ejected in the third quarter for throwing a punch at an opposing player, then arguing with an official. Then Star Jay quarterback Moses Reynolds was ejected in the fourth quarter for throwing a punch at an opposing player.
On the next play, Jay sophomore Victor Rojas and senior Mike Moreno staged their attack on Watts, with one hitting him full force in the back and the other jumping on top of the referee once he was on the ground. The hits were unquestionably deliberate.
Rojas and another uninvolved player were ejected for the attack. Moreno stayed in the game on defense for the final play. After the Marble Falls quarterback took a knee to run out the clock, Moreno plowed into him.
A YouTube video of the assault on Watts, a 14-year veteran referee, has received more than 7 million views. Moreno and Rojas were suspended both from the team and from school while Northside ISD authorities review next steps.
The repeated examples of bad sportsmanship by John Jay players suggest that they're not getting the right message from the adults coaching them. This entire team's culture needs to be rewired, from head coach Gary Gutierrez on down. The John Jay Mustangs need to take the rest of the season off so that cooler heads can prevail the next time players suit up.
And even though Gutierrez reportedly has apologized, it's clear that his leadership failed to give John Jay players a crystal clear understanding of what constitutes out-of-bounds behavior. An ironic quote that Gutierrez shared via Twitter on July 16 sums up our feelings exactly: ""If you're not teaching it that way, then you must be allowing it to happen that way."" Houston Chronicle. Sept. 2, 2015.
Bathroom bogeyman: Scare tactics about the HERO ordinance are beneath the dignity of this great city.
Texans who grew up in Dallas and San Antonio are probably familiar with the Magic Time Machine, a chain of restaurants known more for their manufactured mayhem than for the quality of their food. They'll likely recall that when they needed to go to the restroom, a waiter took them by the hand and led them through the dining room, all the while shouting ""Potty patrol! Potty patrol!"" Laughter invariably ensued.
If we believed that Jared Woodfill, the former head of the Harris County Republican Party, and his fellow opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) were truly concerned about the likelihood of transgender ogres lurking in public restrooms, as they claim in their over-the-top radio ads, we would suggest that Houston restaurants be required to offer a potty patrol service. Of if that's too gauche for this sophisticated trans city ‚Äî transnational we mean ‚Äî may we suggest, a la Paris, Rome and London, the required presence of restroom attendants, individuals paid to spend their working hours in public restrooms, with a saucer near the wash basin where patrons deposit tips.
The fact is, Woodfill and company are not concerned that men dressing up as women are just waiting for HERO to pass ‚Äî and, we presume, for the annual women's apparel sale at Nordstrom ‚Äî so they can don skirts, blouses and high heels and assault women and girls in public bathrooms. Their aim is to defeat an ordinance that partially benefits gay and transgendered Houstonians, people whose lives they can't accept. If they can stir up the general public with scare tactics that border on the absurd, then so be it; they will have saved Houstonians from surrendering to the creeping acceptance of what they believe to be a deviant lifestyle. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, and anyone persuaded by their cynical ploy should be too.
The so-called HERO measure on the November ballot is designed to protect people against discrimination in employment, housing and other sectors. HERO protects gay and transgender people but also bans discrimination based on race, sex, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information. It also bans discrimination based on family, marital or military status. Woodfill and friends focus on the bathroom menace because they calculate that it borders on legitimate concerns about sexual predators and thus will spill over.
""Nothing in the equal rights ordinance changes the fact that it is ‚Äî and always will be ‚Äî illegal to enter a restroom to harm or harass other people,"" Richard Carlbom with the pro-ordinance Houston Unites campaign told the Chronicle.
In addition, none of the states and municipalities that have had anti-discrimination ordinances for years reports any evidence of the kind of abuse or assaults that the Houston opponents are predicting. Minnesota, for example, began prohibiting discrimination against transgender people more than 20 years ago. A Minneapolis police spokesman told Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg that sexual assaults from the 1993 law were ""not even remotely"" a problem, and that a police department inquiry found ""nothing"" in the way of such crimes in the city. Iowa, New Mexico, Maine and Hawaii are among more than a dozen jurisdictions that also report no problems.
Whether Houston needs an anti-discrimination ordinance has been and continues to be a legitimate topic for citizens to debate. We happen to believe it will be good for Houston; others argue that it's superfluous, that protections for some groups already are extended by federal law. Those polar perspectives represent an argument worth having, whereas the bathroom bogeyman claim is beneath the dignity of this great city. We really don't need Woodfill and his anti-HERO pals playing potty patrol for us.

Austin American-Statesman. Sept. 4, 2015.
Supporting equal justice and police not mutually exclusive
Americans shouldn't have to choose sides between law enforcement and equal justice.
But the comments by politicians and law enforcement officials following two police-related shootings in Texas suggest that is unfortunately the current state of affairs in the dialogue about law enforcement and use of force.
Any shooting death is a tragedy. In Houston on Aug. 28, the victim was a Harris County sheriff's deputy who was slain while filling his car at a gas station. The suspect, who allegedly unloaded his gun execution-style into the body of deputy Darren Goforth, has a history of criminal activity and mental illness. In San Antonio, the victim was a 41-year-old man, Gilbert Flores, who had already injured his wife and child as part of a domestic dispute and was behaving erratically, before Bexar County deputies shot and killed him on the lawn while his hands were apparently raised.
There will be some who will recoil at the prospect of calling both Goforth and Flores ""victims."" The circumstances leading up to their deaths do not change their status. Freddie Gray in Baltimore was a victim. Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was a victim. Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos of New York were victims. All are cases that have roiled the national conscience over the past 12 months about the role of race in law enforcement. But the tragic nature of these episodes should not curtail the overdue push for change. It is only through those sometimes tense ‚Äî but hopefully deliberative ‚Äî discussions that we will finally find solutions.
We must support law enforcement officers, who do an incredibly dangerous and difficult job. At the same time, we must require accountability from those who abuse the authority bestowed by the badge. We should be able to mourn Goforth's loss without also being asked to pass judgment on the national Black Lives Matter movement that has brought much-needed attention to policing, use of force and the criminal justice system.
In the months since Ferguson, especially after the grisly murders of officers Liu and Ramos while sitting in their patrol car, law enforcement officials have argued that the Black Lives Matters movement has placed officers in grave danger. That fear is clearly what motivated the disappointing comments by Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman after Goforth's death, when he referenced a ""dangerous national rhetoric that is out there today,"" saying it ""has gotten out of control.""
Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick similarly played into this false narrative last week with an interview on Texas Standard: ""I'm tired of this 'certain lives matter.' All lives do matter and particularly law enforcement. And there is a war on police, by some people. It's a small percentage of people in this country, but they're deadly. It only takes a few of that small group of people who spew this hate toward law enforcement to take the life on an innocent officer.""
He goes on to suggest that we should not ""worry about the one officer or two officers out there on a YouTube dashcam video who did something wrong. If they were wrong, I'll file a complaint, and if their department feels they were wrong, then suspend them or fire them.""
The numbers however simply don't bear out either point. Nationally police firearms deaths are about 13 percent lower in 2015 than last year at this time, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. Goforth's death and the death of an Illinois officer last week bring the total of deaths by gunfire in 2015 to 26. Total deaths in the line of duty are currently higher at 85, including traffic accidents and heart attacks.
Every officer killed in the line of duty is one too many. They are our protectors and peacekeepers. It is not a duty that most take lightly ‚Äî but the magnitude of the task also requires every organization to be capable and open to introspection and public critique.
Minority communities have long complained about unequal treatment and police brutality. But it is the videos that Patrick so casually dismisses that are pushing more policymakers to do something about it. Responses like Patrick's highlight a culture that suggests that if a brown-skinned person is accused of a crime, then they deserve what they get ‚Äî even if it is death. Patrick may be confident in the ability of a simple complaint to set things right, but history suggests that this often not the case.
To that end, our focus should be on justice.
Let's be clear: Activists do not get a free pass. Anyone involved in calls to harm or threatens legitimate police work is a danger to the public and engaging in hate speech. Causing law enforcement to unnecessarily look over its shoulder when quick, decisive thinking is required puts us all at risk.
However, the conversations that are taking place as result of the Black Lives Matter movement should be welcomed. Better policies and better training will help ensure that we all have equal protection under the law.
We can embrace the premise that black and brown lives matter and support our police officers and deputies. We shouldn't accept anything less. Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Sept. 4, 2015.
Let lawmakers set new direction for horse racing If Texas racing needs fixing, let the work begin.
Ranchers, horse trainers and spokesmen say the industry is suffering. They say Texas tracks will struggle without new revenue from electronic games, or maybe casino gambling.
Neither is legal in Texas. Both would require thorough review by both lawmakers and the public, not the agency vote state racing commissioners have tried.
State officials have given the commission a deadline to reverse a vote to add slot-like electronic ""historical racing"" games used elsewhere.
But if gaming is not the answer, leaders must decide what is.
Now is the time for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Texas House officials to appoint a joint interim committee on the future of pari-mutuel racing.
The one-day shutdown of Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie and other Texas horse and dog racing tracks last week has left both industry leaders and track patrons uncertain about the future.
If lawmakers do not set a course quickly, the industry will continue to suffer along with pari-mutuel revenue.
The question should not be only how to save racing, but also if it should be saved.
Total revenue is down by half since 2000, and attendance is on a steady decline. As a result, the purse money for thoroughbreds has shrunk more than 40 percent in the last 10 years, and employment has declined as thoroughbred owners go to races in other states.
The reason is one of simple economics: Other states offer richer purses financed by more gamblers and more games.
Years ago, officials at an Arkansas park devised slot-like race replays called ""historical racing,"" and the state has added video slots and gaming. The 2004 and 2006 openings of two Oklahoma casinos barely across the state line also eroded Texas racing attendance and revenue.
Texas lawmakers have consistently rejected casino slots and any similar electronic games. But the pressure will only intensify to expand gambling for the sake of jobs and the racing industry.
Lawmakers need to make tough choices about racing's future. A joint committee should get started.",Houston Unites,1,2915,81.71,60.27,18.63,9.87,18.45,26.45,82.61,58.9,47.27,8.34,4.12,0.07,0.96,0.07,1.2,1.37,4.22,14.58,8.51,1.51,13.34,7.27,3.12,6.72,1.03,12.38,6.35,3.84,8.54,1.61,0.82,6.14,11.46,0.62,10.63,1.85,1.58,1.58,1.75,0.45,3.77,0.03,5.04,1.96,3.02,1.34,0.27,0.99,0.17,0.24,0.21,0,12.8,5.56,0.34,0.17,1.34,1.2,1.85,7.24,0.14,0.07,0.17,1.37,1.99,1.65,0.07,0.27,4.15,0.96,0.14,2.16,0.99,0.03,2.16,0.48,0.03,0,0.07,0,0.21,0.14,0.58,0.69,0.07,0.75,0.03,0.07,0.03,0.07,0.79,0,3.81,7.34,0.31,1.44,4.84,0.62,0.07,0.17,4.01,3.29,3.91,0.86,0,0,0,0,0,13.79,5.35,3.98,0,0.07,1.78,2.61,0,0.58,0.07,0.24,0.07,0.17,3.58,3.55,3.15,3.33,2.78,-3.39,-2.53,-1.31,-1.61,-2.97,0.51,0.38,0.38,1.03,1.13,0.21,0.62,0,0.93,0.03,0.17,0.1,1,0.45,0.48,0,0.03,0,0.03,0.07,0.07,0.1,0,0.07,1.98,1.93,17.85,171.59,0.72,394.65,-0.69,199.04,1.41,257.38,2.33,126.97,-0.72,257.38,-0.1,477.01,0,144.13,-0.07,41.18,0.41,20.59,0,27.45,96.09,137.27,10.3,27.45,68.63,0.07,188.74,54.91,30.89,65.2,0,0,0,126.97,44.61,130.4,24.02,6.86,0,2.13,1,0.14,0.31,0,0,0.07,0,0.07,0,0.14,0.07,0.14,0.03,1

Trailblazer
Regarding ""Unsung Hero"", (Page B8, Thursday) I was honored to get to meet Phyllis Frye at a GLBT fundraiser several years ago. She has quite a sense of humor, which I imagine helped her deal with a lot of the difficulties she has encountered in her life.
I have thought of her often recently, while reading about the opposition to HERO and the scare tactics about restrooms. That evening, she and I were both attired in formal dresses, and we chatted briefly in the women's restroom while washing our hands. It was entirely appropriate for each of us to be in that room, even though a DNA analysis would have shown her to have a Y chromosome.
I hope that the voters of Houston are sensible enough to see that the restroom issue is a non-issue. The issue is discrimination. And none of us should be willing to tolerate that.
Jeanne Southern, Houston End histrionics
Regarding ""Bathroom bogeymen"" (Page B15, Sunday), I am getting disgusted with the constant diatribes against ""Mayor Parker's Bathroom Ordinance"" blared on the radio. It's the same tripe that men will come into women's bathrooms!
I lived through the era of the Summit, Astrodome and other venues where hordes of women had to avail themselves of the men's facilities. Seldom did the men have to utilize the women's baths because men are better equipped to get in and get out.
Simply, these righteous folks need to travel to other parts of the world where bathrooms are not labeled as gender-specific bathrooms. Our office building has six bathrooms that are not gender-specific. We have never had an issue. Please folks, just read the ordinance
Bob Ryan, Houston About trust
How can our esteemed city government be trusted to get the equal rights ordinance right? Is discrimination ever a good thing? The answer is clearly no.
But we have all seen how the city has handled criticism of the ordinance (subpoenaed sermons), not to mention questionable ballot language and the faulty counting of petition signatures. Until they prove otherwise, how can we trust them to administer HERO?
Does anyone need further proof? We have police and fire pensions that the city agreed to. They appear to be unsustainable, and no one at the city has a clue how to fix the problem. What about the ""rain tax""? Great idea until you realize that it would be our city government administering the fund. It sure didn't take long, as many predicted, before the City Council was raiding the fund for members' pet projects.
Lastly, what about the streets - one of the most basic of city services. Every other major city in the country seems to be able to keep their streets in good stead, but not Houston. It's all a matter of trust. City government needs to earn our trust by fixing the problems facing this great city. Fix those, earn our trust and then let's get after HERO.

Refugees seeking safety
Regarding ""Hungary plays hardball: migrant tempers flare"" (Page A10, Thursday), yes, the western democracies need to oppose the Islamic state as strongly as we can. But we're not employing a valuable weapon in this fight.
Millions of refugees have fled the territories occupied by ISIS in Iraq and Syria. An estimated four million have left Syria. Europe and the United States should resettle more of these unfortunate people. Then they can tell their stories, ripping off the propaganda veil that ISIS has spread over its atrocities.
Nancy Perich Daly, Houston Fiscal incongruity
Regarding ""A big step toward more bayou trails"" and ""Cell-ban signs at schools debated,"" the cell-ban article stated that Mayor Annise Parker questioned the expenditure of $2.34 million to comply with the Texas state law for signage in school zones to help protect school children from distracted drivers. The ""bayou"" article quotes Parker supporting the expenditure of $220 million on green-space recreational improvements as ""one of the most exciting things I've had the opportunity to work on as mayor.""
Obviously, Mayor Parker has prioritized her massively expensive green agenda over the safety of school children.I suspect that a vast majority of Houstonians would prefer that Parker allocate the $2.3 million for the legally mandated school zone safety warning signs and spend the balance of $217.7 million on repairing our decrepit Third World streets which could also include conjoined bike paths.
Edward A. Vesely, West University Place Fiercely defiant
Regarding ""Couple at center of Kentucky fight"" (Page A6, Thursday), it's time to get rid of the ""little terrorist"" of Rowan County, Ky., Kim Davis. Enough is enough.
As a government employee, she has no right to defy the U.S. Supreme Court, which has legalized same-sex marriage in all 50 states. Her job is to serve the people of Rowan County. Her personal beliefs do not supersede her oath to serve the people. If she won't comply with the law then she needs to be reassigned to a different position and replaced with someone who will obey the law and serve the people.
Robert Nackman, Houston State's rights
Regarding ""My religion prohibits gay marriage"" cartoon (Page B8, Thursday), I realize the editorial pages can reflect a variety of, at times, distasteful opinions to both ends of the political spectrum. Your choice to run a cartoon comparing a simple clerk who finds gay marriage distasteful to an ISIS killer is just repulsive.
She has a right to her viewpoint and actions in what should be a state's rights issue, not federal dictate. I am sure it does not include beheading someone.

10/30/15,18,B,HERO picks up some high-level support ,"Houston's anti-discrimination ordinance picked up White House support Thursday when a spokesman said the president and vice president were ""confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.""
""While the administration generally does not take a formal position on specific proposals or initiatives, the president and vice president have been strong supporters of state and local efforts to protect Americans from being discriminated against based on who they are and who they love,"" said the spokesman, Jeff Tiller.
The remarks, first reported by Buzzfeed News, followed those of Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who tweeted her support of the ordinance known as HERO Thursday.
""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love - I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond. #HERO #YesOnProp1,"" Clinton wrote on Twitter.
The ordinance bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance, which can carry fines of up to $5,000, applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting; religious institutions are exempt.
Opponents of the measure, which they refer to as ""the bathroom ordinance,"" say the ordinance would allow men dressed in women's clothing to enter women's restrooms to commit sexual assaults. The highest-profile opponents to date include Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and former Astros star Lance Berkman, who stated his opposition to the ordinance in a television advertisement.
Also Thursday, Academy Award-winning actress Sally Field was in town to voice her support for the ordinance.
The question of whether the ordinance will be upheld has dominated Houston politics for much of the year, and recent attacks about public restroom access have drowned out discussion of discrimination.
City Council approved the ordinance in May 2014, but a judge ordered the city in July to repeal the ordinance or put it before voters on the November ballot after opponents sued the city, complaining the Parker administration illegally ignored their petitions seeking to have the law repealed.

10/30/15,18,Editorial / Columnists,Rangel: All eyes on Houston's anti-discrimination vote ,"AUSTIN ‚Äî Houston voters elect a new mayor on Tuesday but despite a crowded field that includes a veteran state representative, a former congressman and a former sheriff, a contentious local proposition is getting most of the attention and it's even eclipsing the seven statewide propositions on the ballot.
And no wonder.
Civic and business leaders are deeply divided on Proposition 1, an ordinance that would prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and 10 other categories.
Yet it is gender identity opponents are mostly focused on.
For instance, for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Houstonian, the measure would let men use women's bathrooms and other public facilities for ladies.
""No woman should have to share a public restroom or locker room with a man,"" Patrick says in an ad paid for by his campaign.
""This is absurd,"" he said. ""Years ago, a decade ago, we would laugh on even thinking about that the people would cast a ballot to keep men out of ladies' rooms.""
But for supporters of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, the attacks Patrick and other opponents of the so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" use are pure demagoguery.
""The lieutenant governor must know it's illegal now ‚Äî and will always be ‚Äî to enter the wrong restroom,"" Richard Carlborn, spokesman for supporters of the ordinance, told the Houston Chronicle.
""The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance doesn't change that,"" Carlborn said. ""What's shocking is that funders of those opposed to the equal rights ordinance want to roll back protections ‚Äî in 2015 ‚Äî of African-Americans, veterans, women and many other Houstonians.""
The HERO fight, which is getting national attention because Houston is the fourth largest city in the nation and has its first openly gay mayor, is a reminder that despite the June 26 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, lesbian, gay, bi- sexual and transgender Texans still faces numerous obstacles, ordinance supporters say.
""This is another example of the fact that securing the freedom to marry does not solve the problems or provide full equality for gays and transgender people living in Texas,"" said Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, an LGBT advocacy group.
""If it does pass, and I am hopeful that it will, it will provide a local mechanism for over 2 million Houstonians to be able to deal with discrimination if and when it should happen,"" Smith said.
Equally important, if Houston voters approve the ordinance, it would send a strong message to the rest of the state and to the entire nation that the city is fair, tolerant and a good place to live or for business, Smith said.
However, if the ordinance ‚Äî which the Houston City Council approved last year but the Texas Supreme Court ruled later Houston voters should be the deciders ‚Äî is rejected, it will embolden opponents of similar measures in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio and other smaller cities, Smith and other HERO supporters fear. Political observers such as Mark P. Jones of Rice University and Brandon Rottinghaus of the University of Houston say it is difficult to predict whether the ordinance will pass or be defeated.
""It is pretty tight,"" Rottinghaus said. ""I legitimately think it could be like 50-50.""
A higher than average voter turnout is expected because the stakes are high for both camps.
But regardless of the outcome, when the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature is back in session in 2017 anti-LGBT legislation is expected, Smith said.
Patrick, the presiding officer of the Texas Senate, has already issued a long list of interim charges ‚Äî issues state lawmakers take an in-depth look the year before they are in session ‚Äî and they include religious liberty.
Patrick, Gov. Greg Abbott and State Attorney General Ken Paxton have argued Texans don't have to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's same-sex ruling if it violates their religious beliefs.
In short, no matter what Houston voters decide, it looks like same-sex marriage, gender identity and other related issues will remain in the spotlight.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,664,81.94,31.63,21.94,22.09,22.9,27.71,80.12,58.28,44.43,6.17,1.2,0.3,0.15,0,0.3,0.45,4.97,14.46,9.19,1.66,10.54,8.13,2.26,6.78,0.9,14.46,7.83,3.46,7.23,1.36,0.3,5.57,12.95,0.6,12.35,1.2,1.36,1.96,2.26,0,6.17,0.15,3.61,1.81,1.66,0.9,0.45,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,10.69,5.87,0,0.3,1.36,1.05,2.26,5.72,0.45,0,0.9,0.9,4.82,4.52,0.15,0.15,3.01,0,0.3,1.96,0.6,0.45,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.15,0,0.45,0.3,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,0,0.3,0.15,4.22,6.02,0.6,0.6,4.52,0.3,0,0.15,3.31,2.41,5.57,1.81,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,18.98,4.97,7.98,0,0,1.2,4.82,0,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,3.56,3.76,3.37,3.64,2.99,-3.16,-1.51,0.01,-0.38,-0.98,0.3,0.6,0.15,0.3,1.36,0.3,0.45,0,0.75,0.15,1.05,0.3,1.05,0.15,0.3,0,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,2.29,1.91,21.4,165.66,1.36,286.14,-0.15,120.48,0.9,240.96,1.96,90.36,-0.9,316.27,1.2,406.63,0,105.42,-0.3,45.18,0.45,15.06,0,60.24,195.78,225.9,30.12,60.24,150.6,0.45,105.42,165.66,30.12,0,30.12,0.3,0,180.72,0,165.66,105.42,45.18,0,0.75,1,0.59,1.49,0.3,0,0,0.15,0.3,0,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,1

10/30/15,18,Editorial / Columnists,Rangel: All eyes on Houston's anti-discrimination vote ,"AUSTIN ‚Äî Houston voters elect a new mayor on Tuesday but despite a crowded field that includes a veteran state representative, a former congressman and a former sheriff, a contentious local proposition is getting most of the attention and it's even eclipsing the seven statewide propositions on the ballot.
And no wonder.
Civic and business leaders are deeply divided on Proposition 1, an ordinance that would prohibit discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and 10 other categories.
Yet it is gender identity opponents are mostly focused on.
For instance, for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Houstonian, the measure would let men use women's bathrooms and other public facilities for ladies.
""No woman should have to share a public restroom or locker room with a man,"" Patrick says in an ad paid for by his campaign.
""This is absurd,"" he said. ""Years ago, a decade ago, we would laugh on even thinking about that the people would cast a ballot to keep men out of ladies' rooms.""
But for supporters of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, the attacks Patrick and other opponents of the so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" use are pure demagoguery.
""The lieutenant governor must know it's illegal now ‚Äî and will always be ‚Äî to enter the wrong restroom,"" Richard Carlborn, spokesman for supporters of the ordinance, told the Houston Chronicle.
""The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance doesn't change that,"" Carlborn said. ""What's shocking is that funders of those opposed to the equal rights ordinance want to roll back protections ‚Äî in 2015 ‚Äî of African-Americans, veterans, women and many other Houstonians.""
The HERO fight, which is getting national attention because Houston is the fourth largest city in the nation and has its first openly gay mayor, is a reminder that despite the June 26 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage, lesbian, gay, bi- sexual and transgender Texans still faces numerous obstacles, ordinance supporters say.
""This is another example of the fact that securing the freedom to marry does not solve the problems or provide full equality for gays and transgender people living in Texas,"" said Chuck Smith, executive director of Equality Texas, an LGBT advocacy group.
""If it does pass, and I am hopeful that it will, it will provide a local mechanism for over 2 million Houstonians to be able to deal with discrimination if and when it should happen,"" Smith said.
Equally important, if Houston voters approve the ordinance, it would send a strong message to the rest of the state and to the entire nation that the city is fair, tolerant and a good place to live or for business, Smith said.
However, if the ordinance ‚Äî which the Houston City Council approved last year but the Texas Supreme Court ruled later Houston voters should be the deciders ‚Äî is rejected, it will embolden opponents of similar measures in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio and other smaller cities, Smith and other HERO supporters fear. Political observers such as Mark P. Jones of Rice University and Brandon Rottinghaus of the University of Houston say it is difficult to predict whether the ordinance will pass or be defeated.
""It is pretty tight,"" Rottinghaus said. ""I legitimately think it could be like 50-50.""
A higher than average voter turnout is expected because the stakes are high for both camps.
But regardless of the outcome, when the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature is back in session in 2017 anti-LGBT legislation is expected, Smith said.
Patrick, the presiding officer of the Texas Senate, has already issued a long list of interim charges ‚Äî issues state lawmakers take an in-depth look the year before they are in session ‚Äî and they include religious liberty.
Patrick, Gov. Greg Abbott and State Attorney General Ken Paxton have argued Texans don't have to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court's same-sex ruling if it violates their religious beliefs.
In short, no matter what Houston voters decide, it looks like same-sex marriage, gender identity and other related issues will remain in the spotlight.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,664,81.94,31.63,21.94,22.09,22.9,27.71,80.12,58.28,44.43,6.17,1.2,0.3,0.15,0,0.3,0.45,4.97,14.46,9.19,1.66,10.54,8.13,2.26,6.78,0.9,14.46,7.83,3.46,7.23,1.36,0.3,5.57,12.95,0.6,12.35,1.2,1.36,1.96,2.26,0,6.17,0.15,3.61,1.81,1.66,0.9,0.45,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,10.69,5.87,0,0.3,1.36,1.05,2.26,5.72,0.45,0,0.9,0.9,4.82,4.52,0.15,0.15,3.01,0,0.3,1.96,0.6,0.45,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,1.2,0.15,0,0.45,0.3,0.45,0.3,0.15,0,0,0.3,0.15,4.22,6.02,0.6,0.6,4.52,0.3,0,0.15,3.31,2.41,5.57,1.81,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,18.98,4.97,7.98,0,0,1.2,4.82,0,0.15,0,0,0.15,0,3.56,3.76,3.37,3.64,2.99,-3.16,-1.51,0.01,-0.38,-0.98,0.3,0.6,0.15,0.3,1.36,0.3,0.45,0,0.75,0.15,1.05,0.3,1.05,0.15,0.3,0,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,2.29,1.91,21.4,165.66,1.36,286.14,-0.15,120.48,0.9,240.96,1.96,90.36,-0.9,316.27,1.2,406.63,0,105.42,-0.3,45.18,0.45,15.06,0,60.24,195.78,225.9,30.12,60.24,150.6,0.45,105.42,165.66,30.12,0,30.12,0.3,0,180.72,0,165.66,105.42,45.18,0,0.75,1,0.59,1.49,0.3,0,0,0.15,0.3,0,0.3,0.3,0.3,0,1
10/30/15,18,Domestic,White House offers support for Houston equal rights measure ,"HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, got support this week from heavy hitters including the White House and high tech giant Apple.
Houston residents will vote Tuesday on the contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
""While the Administration generally does not take a formal position on specific proposals or initiatives, the President and Vice President have been strong supporters of state and local efforts to protect Americans from being discriminated against based on who they are and who they love,"" White House spokesman Jeff Tiller said in a statement Thursday.
""We're confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.""
Supporters of the ordinance say the measure would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but it would provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, who contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality, have focused their campaign on labeling it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms. The ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy has been called highly misleading by Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance.
Cupertino, California-based Apple said its ""stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.""
""Apple supports Proposition 1 as it sends a clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity,"" the company added in its statement.
Apple CEO Tim Cook came out last year as the first openly gay chief executive of a Fortune 500 company.
Houston's ordinance also has received support from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who on Thursday tweeted: ""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love_I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond.""
The high-profile support comes as the outcome of Tuesday's vote is considered uncertain, with one political expert believing the measure is leaning toward being defeated.
Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said the ordinance ""could go to defeat by a big margin"" because of possibly heavy Republican voter turnout.
""That's probably why you have the efforts in the last days of the election (to show support from) the president, Hillary Clinton,"" he said.
Kevin Nix, a spokesman for Houston Unites, the campaign backing the ordinance, said the high-profile support will ""boost the momentum as we head into Tuesday.""
""I think it's going to be a tight race but we're feeling pretty good,"" he said.
Houston Unites announced Friday that other companies also have offered their support of the ordinance, including General Electric, Hewlett-Packard and BASF. But Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston, which is fighting the ordinance, called the big-name support a sign of desperation.
""It's a Hail Mary pass at the last minute that is not going to work,"" he said.
Woodfill said opponents of the ordinance have included a diverse group of individuals, including pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.
One of those officials, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, on Thursday tweeted: ""HOUSTON: Liberals from Hollywood and Washington, D.C. are trying to impose their radical agenda in Texas.

10/30/15,18,Domestic,White House offers support for Houston equal rights measure ,"HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston, the nation's fourth largest city, got support this week from heavy hitters including the White House and high tech giant Apple.
Houston residents will vote Tuesday on the contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
""While the Administration generally does not take a formal position on specific proposals or initiatives, the President and Vice President have been strong supporters of state and local efforts to protect Americans from being discriminated against based on who they are and who they love,"" White House spokesman Jeff Tiller said in a statement Thursday.
""We're confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.""
Supporters of the ordinance say the measure would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but it would provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, who contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality, have focused their campaign on labeling it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms. The ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy has been called highly misleading by Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance.
Cupertino, California-based Apple said its ""stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.""
""Apple supports Proposition 1 as it sends a clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity,"" the company added in its statement.
Apple CEO Tim Cook came out last year as the first openly gay chief executive of a Fortune 500 company.
Houston's ordinance also has received support from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who on Thursday tweeted: ""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love_I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond.""
The high-profile support comes as the outcome of Tuesday's vote is considered uncertain, with one political expert believing the measure is leaning toward being defeated.
Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University in Houston, said the ordinance ""could go to defeat by a big margin"" because of possibly heavy Republican voter turnout.
""That's probably why you have the efforts in the last days of the election (to show support from) the president, Hillary Clinton,"" he said.
Kevin Nix, a spokesman for Houston Unites, the campaign backing the ordinance, said the high-profile support will ""boost the momentum as we head into Tuesday.""
""I think it's going to be a tight race but we're feeling pretty good,"" he said.
Houston Unites announced Friday that other companies also have offered their support of the ordinance, including General Electric, Hewlett-Packard and BASF. But Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston, which is fighting the ordinance, called the big-name support a sign of desperation.
""It's a Hail Mary pass at the last minute that is not going to work,"" he said.
Woodfill said opponents of the ordinance have included a diverse group of individuals, including pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.

10/28/15,18,Business,Commentary - Indiana provides a lesson on the Equal Rights Ordinance ,"When voting on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, remember Indiana.
Ultraconservative lawmakers there introduced a so-called Religious Freedom Restoration Act that legalized discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity earlier this year.
Responsible Republican leaders, including former U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar and Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard, warned that it would condone bigotry and hatred. Dozens of Indiana business leaders called for an additional law explicitly banning discrimination against those groups. The bigots ignored their pleas, and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed the act into law on March 26.
That's when the backlash began.
National business leaders couldn't condemn the law fast enough. Apple, Wal-Mart, the NBA, the NFL, the NCAA, PayPal, Yelp and dozens of religious denominations demanded the law's repeal or overhaul. Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, announced his company would suspend all travel to Indiana. Angie's List canceled a $40 million expansion of its Indianapolis headquarters. #BoycottIndiana trended on Twitter.
After a week of outrage, the Indiana Senate and House leaders announced a new law that would forbid discrimination. Supporters of the original act declared defeat.
The lesson? Discrimination is bad for business.
Now a small minority of Houstonians are trying to leverage a traditionally low-turnout election to repeal an equal rights ordinance that is already embraced in 15 other major cities and is boilerplate policy at most large corporations.
If misguided voters repeal HERO, it won't be the bigots who pay the price in H-town. Businesses will suffer the boycotts, and talented workers will decline job offers in what many will call Hate-town.
""Do you want Houston to be seen as a city that discriminates or not?"" said Laura Murillo, CEO of the Houston Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which has 180,000 members. ""There has been so much investment in hotels, restaurants and other businesses to attract out-of-town visitors, we don't want anything to reflect a discriminatory environment.""
Houston's business organizations almost universally support HERO, Murillo said. The Greater Houston Partnership played a major role in drafting the ordinance, and dozens of major corporations and trade organizations are rallying support for it.
Because Texas universities don't graduate enough students to meet business demand, local companies must recruit from outside the state to find workers with advanced degrees. Younger workers care about equal rights, and any employer will tell you that Houston isn't perceived to be as idyllic as cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York.
""People have a choice of whether they come here for leisure, for a convention, to relocate a business or to move here for a job,"" said Ric Campo, CEO of real estate giant Camden Property Trust. ""Millennials are the future workforce, and we have to show that we are a city that stands for what they believe in, a diverse city where we protect people.""
Rebuke from the public
Ask Houston Texans owner Bob McNair how important equal rights are to his business and employees. After he wrote a check to his buddies leading the fight against HERO, he felt the sting of public disapproval and quickly asked for a refund. He knows to put commerce ahead of ill-advised culture wars.
And there is no doubt this vote is about discrimination. Dr. Steven Hotze made that abundantly clear with his hateful, ignorant and misleading rhetoric about gays. Hotze acolyte Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, an expert in polemics and misdirection, has won several elections by promoting bigotry against homosexuals and transgender people, and now he's using those tactics against HERO.
If you are naive enough to think this fight is about bathrooms, that word does not appear in the ordinance. Bad behavior in public restrooms will remain just as illegal as it is now. Bigots have used the ""we must protect the womenfolk"" trope for centuries to stir emotions, justify discrimination and even promote lynchings. Don't ruin the city's reputation based on misinformation.
Community standards
HERO protects 15 groups, including pregnant women, veterans and senior citizens. The ordinance's punishments are so mild that they do little more than encourage our better angels to overcome our personal prejudices.
In other words, HERO is not so much a law, but a statement about the kind of community and people we want to be. If you care about the reputation and prosperity of your business, your employer or your city, vote yes on Proposition 1.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,720,78.9,74.83,11.1,17.03,16,30.14,82.36,57.22,44.44,7.5,3.89,0,1.11,0.97,1.11,0.56,3.61,13.75,7.22,1.39,12.64,6.53,3.75,6.67,1.39,12.92,6.53,4.17,10.28,2.36,1.39,6.81,10.56,0.28,9.86,1.67,1.39,1.39,1.94,0.28,4.17,0.14,6.81,3.19,3.47,1.11,0,0.97,0,0.42,0,0,17.5,8.06,0.83,0,1.94,2.08,1.81,9.58,0.14,0.14,0.28,1.11,1.67,1.53,0.14,0,8.61,0.56,0.14,6.53,3.19,0.42,0.97,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.56,0.14,0.14,0.69,0.42,0,0,0.56,0,0.14,0.56,0,2.92,6.53,0.28,0.83,4.44,0.56,0,0.28,2.78,2.78,4.17,1.39,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,17.36,6.39,6.11,0.28,0,1.81,2.78,0,0.97,0,0,0,0.14,3.96,4.25,3.74,3.77,3.16,-1.72,-0.27,0.04,-0.56,-0.51,0.69,0.83,0.28,0.42,2.08,1.53,1.11,0,1.67,0.14,0.28,0.14,1.81,0.28,0.83,0,0.14,0,0,0,0.14,0.14,0,0,2.5,2.01,18.41,180.56,0.83,555.56,-0.28,166.67,0.69,250,2.08,97.22,-0.69,291.67,0.42,486.11,0,125,0,69.44,0.69,27.78,0,55.56,111.11,180.56,0,0,69.44,0,97.22,55.56,0,55.56,13.89,0.14,0,55.56,83.33,305.56,13.89,13.89,0,0.97,1,0.83,0.83,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.83,0,0.14,0,1
10/28/15,18,Cheat Sheet,Houston Baseball Legend Stokes Trans Bathroom Panic ,"Fear-Mongering
Ex-Astros star Lance Berkman is appearing on ads all over Houston saying he's worried about 'troubled men' sharing a restroom with his daughters. But the trans women have more to fear.
Shop ‚ñæ
Houston Astros legend Lance Berkman is afraid that his four daughters could use the same restroom as transgender women, and
he wants you to know about it.
In an ad for Campaign for Houston‚Äîa PAC opposed to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), an LGBT nondiscrimination measure supported by Mayor Annise Parker that will be decided by a ballot proposition on Nov. 3‚ÄîBerkman introduces himself with his baseball credentials before segueing into some of the worst transphobic fear-mongering the debate over LGBT legal protections has seen so far.
""I would like to protect my girls from as many threats that are out there as I possibly can.""
""My wife and I have four daughters,"" the recently retired athlete says in the ad. ""Proposition 1 would allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms.""
Berkman adds in a behind-the-scenes video for the spot that the idea of transgender people is ""a little strange to [him],"" before sounding the alarm over the possibility that a child predator could abuse the ordinance to attack his daughters.
""As a husband and a father, you feel like you're in a position of protector over your family,"" Berkman says. ""I would like to protect my girls from as many threats that are out there as I possibly can.""
In the October buildup to the vote, Campaign for Houston has been getting as much mileage out of the one-time MLB player as it can. Berkman, who played for the Astros from 1999 to 2004, has been featured in radio spots, and one Houston resident told The Daily Beast that he has been receiving robocalls featuring a recorded message from Berkman for the past few weeks. As Proposition 1 picks up endorsements in the final days before the election, Berkman's star status has been invoked as proof that the anti-HERO campaign is still going strong.
Asked if Campaign for Houston was struggling, spokesman Jared Woodfill told KPRC, ""Absolutely not,"" adding, ""We've got a lot of high-profile people, including Lance Berkman and others, who've taken a strong, principled stand.""
Right off the bat‚Äîpun intended‚Äîit should be made clear that Berkman's widely publicized fears about transgender people in bathrooms are completely unsubstantiated.
As The Daily Beast's Jay Michaelson noted earlier this year, ""To be clear, there is not a single case‚Äînot one‚Äîof a trans woman assaulting other women in a public restroom.""
The Advocate also confirmed in March that ""there has never been a verifiable, reported instance of a trans person harassing a cisgender [non-transgender] person."" In April, Mic surveyed the Transgender Law Center, the Human Rights Campaign, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the National Center for Transgender Equality, none of which could find statistical evidence of the sort of violence that critics like Berkman fear will result from nondiscrimination ordinances. Lance Berkman played in St. Louis. Guess his girls didn't go to his games! SL has a non-discrimination ordinance.-A http://t.co/gzEbKIYOd9

Then Lance Berkman went to Dallas. Oops. Dallas amended its Charter to clarify gender identity protections. Can you spell hypocrite?-A
‚Äî Annise Parker (@AnniseParker) October 5, 2015
Indeed, as Mayor Parker noted on Twitter, Berkman and his family have already lived in cities that have LGBT nondiscrimination ordinances.
On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence to prove that bathrooms are dangerous and often inaccessible places for transgender people.
In a survey of transgender people by the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, 68 percent of respondents reported experiencing verbal harassment in a public restroom, and 9 percent reported experiencing a form of physical assault. Eighteen percent had been denied access to a public restroom. The 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey (PDF) found that 22 percent of transgender employees had been denied access to an appropriate restroom in their own workplace.
Going to the bathroom is an experience fraught with anxiety for transgender people. And for good reason‚Äîunlike the specter of the trans bathroom predator that critics like Berkman repeatedly raise, stories about the violence trans people face in bathrooms can be confirmed.
In 2011, a young transgender woman named Chrissy Lee Polis tried to use the restroom at a McDonald's in Maryland and was brutally beaten by another woman and a 14-year-old-girl. A McDonald's employee simply filmed the incident rather than intervening. The employee was later fired and Polis's adult attacker was imprisoned.
Berkman's advertisements highlight one of the cruelest ironies of today's anti-trans panic: While critics suggest repeatedly that transgender people in bathrooms are dangerous, bathrooms are one of the most dangerous places for transgender people to be.
And although Berkman might find transgender identity ""a little strange"" or believe that transgender people are ""troubled,"" his 15-year career in baseball doesn't exactly credential him to contradict the conclusions of the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Public Health Association, and several other leading health care associations (PDF). Even with more than 350 home runs.
Campaign for Houston did not respond to The Daily Beast's request for comment and clarification. A spokesperson for the Houston Astros told The Daily Beast that the team has no comment on Berkman's participation in Campaign for Houston.
Houston's HERO legislation‚Äîa nondiscrimination ordinance that would prohibit anti-LGBT discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodations‚Äîhas been caught in legal and judicial turmoil for over a year.
In 2014, Mayor Parker, who is openly lesbian, introduced the legislation to the Houston City Council, where it passed 11-6 last May to the dismay of some local pastors, who supported a campaign to repeal the ordinance by petition. In July of this year, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance must either be repealed or put on the ballot. Now, on Nov. 3, Houstonians will decide on HERO in what looks to be a tight vote: Support for HERO is at 43 percent and opposition at 37 percent in the latest poll.
With Texas often named as one of the worst states in the country for LGBT people, the debate over HERO in Houston has drawn national attention. Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States and the most populous to elect an openly gay mayor.
With no evidence to support the anti-transgender scare tactics that are often used to argue against nondiscrimination ordinances, opponents like Berkman frame the issue as a matter of preventing crimes rather than responding to an established threat. In his Campaign for Houston ad, Berkman says, ""It's better to prevent this danger by closing women's restrooms to men rather than waiting for a crime to happen.""
This despite the fact that nondiscrimination ordinances have already been passed in other major cities without incident and laws are already in place to prosecute anyone who enters a restroom for the wrong reasons, according to the Parker administration.
""It is already illegal for anyone to enter a restroom to cause a disturbance,"" Janice Evans, chief policy officer for Mayor Parker, told The Daily Beast. ""That will not change if HERO remains in place.""
Berkman might be a local legend, then, but his opposition to Proposition 1 is based in myth.",Campaign for Houston ,1,1242,94.33,66.12,16.72,5.96,23.43,27.38,81.88,56.68,46.54,6.2,2.9,0.64,0.08,0.4,1.29,0.08,3.3,15.7,9.5,2.58,16.18,7,2.74,4.51,0.89,12.08,5.31,3.7,5.96,1.29,0.24,4.51,9.98,0.56,9.34,1.61,1.13,1.37,1.61,0.81,2.66,0,5.72,2.01,3.7,1.61,0.4,1.21,0.89,0.16,0,0,13.61,5.88,0.56,0.08,1.45,1.05,1.93,8.13,0.56,0,1.45,1.77,3.14,2.66,0.4,0.08,2.98,0.56,0.4,1.85,0.08,0.08,2.66,0.48,0,0.16,0.08,0,0.48,0.16,0,0.08,0.08,0.4,0,0.08,0,0,1.13,0.16,3.7,7.97,0.16,1.13,6.12,0.24,0.08,0.16,3.3,3.78,4.03,0.89,0.16,0.08,0.08,0,0,17.15,4.35,5.07,0.08,0.08,1.77,5.8,0,0.16,0,0.56,0.16,0,3.13,3.07,2.79,2.83,2.42,-3.45,-1.67,-0.81,-1.27,-2.29,0.32,0.65,0.4,0.89,0.56,0.24,0.48,0,0.4,0.08,0,0,0.4,0.24,0.08,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.52,1.85,14.86,153.23,0.97,379.03,-0.97,88.71,0.81,177.42,0.56,64.52,-0.16,177.42,0.48,266.13,0,120.97,0,32.26,0.32,16.13,0,88.71,72.58,161.29,64.52,16.13,129.03,-0.08,129.03,56.45,0,8.06,0,0,0,80.65,16.13,120.97,217.74,24.19,8.06,2.1,1,0.16,1.13,0.08,0.16,0.08,0.24,0,0,0.16,0.08,1.61,0,1

10/27/15,18,B,Garcia spends big as he looks to make runoff - Former sheriff boosted advertising to counter criticism of his record ,"Adrian Garcia outspent his chief rivals in the Houston mayor's race over the last month, hoping to hold what polls suggest is his slipping grip on a spot in the likely December runoff.
The final round of campaign finance filings before the Nov. 3 election, covering the period from late September through last Saturday, showed Garcia's $1.1 million outlay made up a third of all six top campaigns' spending for the period.
About $860,000 of the former Harris County sheriff's expenditures were for advertising, double that of former Kemah Mayor Bill King, who some polls show is Garcia's closest rival.
Garcia needed to increase his advertising to combat a slew of negative attacks from opponents related to his management of the sheriff's office, said Mark Jones, a University of Houston political scientist.
""Originally, he was holding back quite a bit, hoping to have a larger war chest going into the runoff,"" Jones said. ""But he does not occupy the clear-cut second post that he did two months ago. He is still within striking distance, but he can't hold much back; it's a now-or-never situation.""
Campaign spokeswoman Mary Bell said Garcia's spending has been timed to reach voters who are still undecided in the race to succeed term-limited Mayor Annise Parker.
""This campaign, like Adrian Garcia as a public servant, has been fiscally responsible in deploying its resources to the right voters at the right time,"" Bell said.
Candidate spending
City Councilman Steve Costello, who has been a strong fundraiser but trails Garcia and King in most polls, posted the second- highest outlay for the period, at $732,000. Of that, he spent $652,000 on advertising and was helped by another $251,000 in ad spending by a political action committee organized to support him called Houstonians for the Future.
King spent $572,700 in the period, about $429,000 of it on advertising. He stopped running TV ads in the middle of last week but was to resume them on Tuesday, campaign spokesman Jim McGrath said.
That gap is not concerning, McGrath said, pointing to consistent radio buys, key endorsements and strong early turnout from conservative areas.
""We like where we are,"" McGrath said. ""We could spend a good chunk of money on broadcast, but it's all about getting the most bang for your buck. We like cable.""
State Rep. Sylvester Turner, who remains the presumed frontrunner, raised nearly $400,000 in the period, spent the third-highest amount at $626,000 and entered this week with $285,000 on hand - roughly the same amount as Garcia and Costello. King entered the week with $123,350 banked.
Former Congressman Chris Bell, who has lagged in fundraising, spent $106,000 in the period and entered the final week with $60,500 on hand. Former City Attorney Ben Hall, who loaned his campaign $850,000 earlier in the year, continued to post low fundraising totals and spent $134,000 in the period, leaving himself nearly $694,000 on hand.
In the heated campaign over Houston's equal rights ordinance, supporters raised $1.7 million, more than quadruple opponents' reported $385,845.
Critics of the law have two political action committees, and as of Monday night the campaign had filed a report for only one. Spokesman Jared Woodfill said the group had raised $323,350 in addition to the $62,495 reported in the group's first filing.
Supporters drew big-ticket donations from national lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy groups, including $250,000 from the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, more than $186,000 from the Human Rights Committee and $150,000 apiece from Colorado's Gill Action and the New York-based American Unity Fund. Mayor Annise Parker kicked in another $90,000 from her campaign fund.
'Grassroots coalition'
Houston Unites campaign manager Richard Carlbom touted the significantly higher fundraising total as proof of a groundswell of support for the law. The campaign has raised almost $3 million since launching in mid-August.
""Compared to the handful of wealthy opponents funding the rollback of needed protections for African Americans, Latinos, women and veterans, we have put together a massive, diverse grassroots coalition backing Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance,"" Carlbom said in a written statement.

10/26/15,18,Metro,HOUSTON TO VOTE ON LGBT NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE ,"After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with
2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance would consolidate bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in
2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.

10/26/15,18,News,Showdown in Houston over nondiscrimination ordinance ,"HOUSTON - After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.

Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city - seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 - city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT nondiscrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure - the Equality Act - was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country - it's not easy, said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts - bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass, said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan - backed by many major corporations - to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities - including Pence's hometown of Columbus - recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections.

10/26/15,18,Obits,LGBT rights groups look to Houston vote \ - Nondiscrimination measure seen as nationally significant ,"After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city -- seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 -- city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters. In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17, including New Jersey, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure -- the Equality Act -- was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country -- it's not easy,"" said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts -- bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan -- backed by many major corporations -- to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities -- including Pence's hometown of Columbus -- recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter.

Whale watch vessel sinks, at least 3 dead
At least three people died after a whale watching boat with 27 people on board sank off Vancouver Island, Canadian authorities said late Sunday.
The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre confirmed that the vessel made a mayday call shortly before 4 p.m. Sunday near Tofino, British Columbia.
Jenn Hamilton, a spokeswoman for British Columbia Emergency Health Services, said at least three people were dead. ""That was shortly after this incident happened,"" Hamilton said.
Hamilton said she did not have further details including nationalities of the deceased.
She didn't know how far off the coast of British Columbia the boat sank. Five ambulances were dispatched and many off duty paramedics went to the dock to help, she said. Asked how many were dead, British Columbia Coroner spokeswoman Barb McLintock earlier said in an email: ""Multiple but we don't yet have a firm number. Still a very fluid situation so we really are not sure yet.""
Brandon Hilbert from Tofino Water Taxi said local companies were helping with the rescue effort. - Associated Press
GOP voters see Trump as the most electable
WASHINGTON - Republican voters view Donald Trump as their strongest general election candidate, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll that highlights the sharp contrast between the party's voters and its top professionals regarding the billionaire businessman's ultimate political strength.
Seven in 10 Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say Trump could win in November 2016 if he is nominated, and that's the most who say so of any candidate. By comparison, 6 in 10 say the same for retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who, like Trump, has tapped into the powerful wave of antiestablishment anger defining the early phases of the 2016 contest.
""It's the lifelong establishment politicians on both sides that rub me the wrong way,"" said registered Republican Joe Selig, a 60-year- old carpenter from Vallejo, California. ""I think Trump is more electable. He's strong. We need strength these days.""
Trump and Carson are considered among the least electable general election candidates by the Republican Party's professionals, those who are in the business of helping candidates run campaigns and win elections.
Experienced political strategists note that winning a general election and winning the Republican nomination are often very different tasks.

Kerry's mission pushes issues aside JERUSALEM - John Kerry's latest Mideast mission has aimed for the modest goal of easing tensions around Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site - the focal point of more than a month of deadly unrest.
But the steps announced by the U.S. secretary of state over the weekend did little to address the deeper issues behind the fighting, disappointing the Palestinians and raising fears that even if calm is restored, it is just a matter of time before another round of violence erupts.
During a swing through the region, Kerry announced the steps on Saturday after several days of meetings with Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian leaders. The highlight was a Jordanian proposal to install surveillance cameras at the Jerusalem holy site that is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary.
More than a month of violence has been fueled by Palestinian allegations that Israel is trying to change the delicate status quo at the site, which allows non-Muslims to visit but not pray.

Another challenge for Obama health care law
WASHINGTON - Opponents of President Barack Obama's health care overhaul are taking yet another challenge to the law to the Supreme Court, and say they will be back with more if this one fails.
A new appeal being filed Monday by the Pacific Legal Foundation contends that the law violates the provision of the Constitution that requires tax-raising bills to originate in the House of Representatives.
Pacific Legal Foundation lawyer Timothy Sandefur said the problem with the law is just one example of how ""Obamacare is so unconstitutional in so many ways.""
Sandefur said the justices will face one challenge to the law after another until it is significantly changed or repealed.
The court has twice turned back major challenges to the health care law, in opinions written by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 and in June. The court also has allowed family-owned businesses with religious objections to opt out of paying for contraceptives for women covered under their health plans. A related case involving faith-oriented colleges, hospitals and charities is pending.

Mexico's Pacific coast starts to assess damage. EL REBALSE, Mexico - The town square in El Rebalse is now an island amid Hurricane Patricia's floodwaters, a place for Maria Santana Vazquez and her husband to rest Sunday after wading through water, at times chest deep, trying to return home.
All around, kids swam, a dog paddled and just before noon two high-clearance army transport trucks arrived - the first outside help since Patricia, the hemisphere's strongest hurricane on record, roared in Friday night and washed out the only paved road into town.
While Mexico for the most part was relieved that the storm caused no fatalities and only marginal damage in the resort of Puerto Vallarta and the principle port of Manzanillo, the sparsely populated zone of Pacific coast where Patricia delivered its fury was only beginning to assess the full damage Sunday.
President Enrique Pena Nieto said Saturday that 3,000 to 3,500 homes were damaged and about 8,650 acres of farmland were hurt.

Laser treatments may help 'napalm girl'
MIAMI - In the photograph that made Kim Phuc a living symbol of the Vietnam War, her burns aren't visible - only her agony as she runs wailing toward the camera, her arms flung away from her body, naked because she has ripped off her burning clothes.
More than 40 years later she can hide the scars beneath long sleeves, but a single tear down her otherwise radiant face betrays the pain she has endured since that errant napalm strike in 1972.
Now she has a new chance to heal - a prospect she once thought possible only in a life after death.
""So many years I thought that I have no more scars, no more pain when I'm in heaven. But now - heaven on earth for me!"" Phuc said.

Family remembers victim of school attack
TROLLHATTAN, Sweden (AP) - When Lavin Eskander's family describes his cheerful personality and his passion for music, they switch back and forth between present and past tense, as if they haven't fully accepted that he's not coming back.
The 20-year-old teacher's assistant was stabbed to death Thursday as he tried to shield children at a school in southern Sweden from a masked, sword-wielding attacker. Fifteen-year-old Ahmed Hassan was also stabbed to death and two other people seriously injured in what police are calling a racist hate crime.
Police shot and killed the attacker.
""My brother wanted to be an artist,"" Leith Eskander, 22, said Sunday. ""He wanted to be famous and spread his songs and his love to the people.""

10/26/15,18,A,Showdown over nondiscrimination ordinance ,"HOUSTON ‚Äî After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.

10/26/15,18,News,Showdown in Houston over nondiscrimination ordinance ,"
HOUSTON - After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance, said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.

The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating, Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city - seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 - city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT nondiscrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure - the Equality Act - was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country - it's not easy, said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts - bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass, said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan - backed by many major corporations - to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities - including Pence's hometown of Columbus - recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. ""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us, Douglas said. ""And we want to give them a perfect example of what a major, diverse city ought to look like.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,1186,90.85,50.61,38.61,20.23,20.45,31.96,80.69,56.75,45.53,6.32,2.45,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.42,0.51,3.88,15.35,8.68,2.53,14.5,6.91,3.29,4.81,0.84,12.39,6.41,4.13,7.42,2.11,1.1,4.47,9.7,0.76,8.77,1.01,1.18,1.26,1.01,0.84,3.12,0,2.87,1.43,1.43,1.1,0.25,0.84,0.25,0.51,0,0,11.8,5.48,0.42,0.17,1.52,0.42,1.6,5.14,0.17,0,0.93,0.17,4.13,4.05,0,0.08,3.46,0.08,0.67,1.43,0.17,1.18,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,0,0,0.17,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.17,1.26,0,3.12,10.12,0.34,1.6,8.18,0.42,0,0,4.05,3.54,4.22,1.1,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.13,5.82,6.32,0,0,1.94,4.05,0,0.25,0,0.08,0,0.25,3.37,3.46,3.17,3.5,2.81,-2.99,-1.26,0,-0.81,-1.09,0.59,0.76,0.08,0,0.76,0.67,0.76,0,0.51,0,0.84,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.76,1.02,17.37,193.93,1.52,244.52,-0.08,67.45,0.51,252.95,2.02,75.89,-0.76,261.38,0.84,278.25,0,151.77,-0.08,75.89,0.42,42.16,0,67.45,227.66,118.04,33.73,16.86,101.18,0.34,67.45,84.32,16.86,33.73,0,0,0,84.32,33.73,84.32,59.02,33.73,8.43,0.34,1,0.67,1.1,0.08,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.51,0.17,0.17,0,1
10/26/15,18,A,HERO foes narrow focus - Critics single out transgender rights in face of acceptance gap ,"When conservative firebrand Dr. Steven Hotze unsheathed a sword in August while speaking at a conservative rally that doubled as a campaign launch against Houston's nondiscrimination ordinance, even some politically aligned with the longtime anti-gay activist were taken aback.
In an incendiary, lengthy address, Hotze went on to link America's war against Nazi Germany to the war on gay rights, urging all gay Houstonians to flee to San Francisco. The sword, he said, was meant to represent God's word, the strongest weapon against the gay community.
""The homosexuals are hate-mongers,"" Hotze said at the time. ""They hate God, they hate God's word, they hate Christ, they hate anything that's good and wholesome and right. They want to pervert everything.""
But since the speech, which played out on Twitter and drew media attention, Hotze largely has dulled his rhetoric against gay rights, at least when it comes to the equal rights ordinance now before voters. Instead, Hotze quietly has bankrolled opponents and stuck to the campaign's biggest talking point: that the law would allow men, including sexual predators, into women's restrooms.
This message is notable for its stridency and for what ordinance supporters say is its fear-mongering inaccuracy, but also because it shunts aside Hotze's decades-long war against gays and lesbians. The campaign instead aims only at transgender residents, and in particular transgender women, who were born male but identify as female.
Evidence suggests the strategy is a politically savvy one.
Despite recent social and legal victories for gays and lesbians - from growing public acceptance to earning the right last June to marry in any state - research and polling data show transgender residents are starting from nearly scratch. Supporters say that makes the protections extended to transgender residents under the law even more crucial.
""Transgender people are at least 20 years behind the larger gay and lesbian community in terms of public understanding and acceptance,"" said Michael Silverman, director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. ""The vast majority of Americans still report that they do not know anyone who is openly transgender. That lack of knowledge and lack of acceptance creates a gap that our opponents attempt to fill with misleading information designed to scare people.""
Most pressing 'threat'
The opponents' campaign spokesman, Jared Woodfill, said the group's decision was not about targeting transgender residents, but instead about identifying the law's most pressing ""public safety threat."" A recent controversial television spot showed a man entering a bathroom stall occupied by a young girl.
""We have to focus like a laser on the most objectionable portions of this,"" Woodfill said. ""So the immediate threat coming from day one is the safety threat to our wives, our daughters and our mothers.""
Houston Unites spokesman Richard Carlbom said it's clear opponents have singled out transgender residents in an attempt to ""create anxiety."" Supporters note the ordinance bans discrimination based not only on sexual orientation and gender identity but also on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance, which can carry fines of up to $5,000, applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting; religious institutions are exempt.
""Most Houstonians, like most Americans, have gay and lesbian friends,"" Carlbom said. ""Most people don't know a transgender person that they know of. The lack of familiarity means it can be easy for people to have questions or concerns or be made to be afraid, and that's exactly what the other side does.""
Nearly 90 percent of Americans reported personally knowing someone who is gay or lesbian in a 2013 Pew Research Center survey. Just 16 percent of Americans, however, told researchers in another poll that they knew a transgender person.
The Pew researchers drew a connection between this knowledge gap and a relative lack of social acceptance of transgender residents, who comprise an estimated 0.3 percent of the population.
A similar gap applied even among gays and lesbians, most of whom said they struggled to grasp transgender individuals' challenges.
Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly gay leader of a major U.S. city and a longtime LGBT activist, said she, too, identifies with this disconnect. Parker also said the campaign against her equal rights ordinance reaffirms her desire to pass it because the law seeks to protect vulnerable groups like transgender residents.
""They have taken a misunderstood group, demonized them, and then flat-out lied about the consequences of the ordinance,"" Parker said. ""They are less understood. And I can't say - even with transgender friends and acquaintances and a long association with the transgender community - that I completely understand it. But I don't have to understand it. I just have to give another human being respect.""
'Fear of the unknown'
Activists said several factors contribute to the gap in social acceptance beyond the small number of transgender residents.
For one, gender identity is a more complex issue than sexual orientation, activist Melanie Pang said, and a harder one to discuss in a culture with rigid gender roles. For instance, she said, parents host parties to reveal a baby's gender and pick nursery colors by gender.
""We don't talk about gender and the spectrum that it is. With that lack of education, we're trying to bring people along on an issue that has been so deeply entrenched in our society,"" she said. ""It's confusing to people. It's fear of the unknown.""
Transgender activist Lou Weaver agreed.
""We are starting over because it's such a whole new concept. We have to pull back multiple layers, and we're not even close to being able to pull them back,"" he said. ""It's a tough situation to be sitting in.""
Weaver and Silverman said the acceptance gap also is driven partly by the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) movement for years putting other issues first. Gays and lesbians can serve openly in the military, for example, but transgender residents cannot. New York passed legislation a decade ago protecting gays and lesbians, but extended those protections to transgender residents only last week. The director of the Human Rights Campaign apologized last year for this history and promised a new focus on equality for transgender residents.
This rising visibility, aided by the public transition of Caitlyn Jenner, Weaver said, has made transgender residents a target. Indeed, the bathroom fight has been repeated in conservatives' messaging from Arkansas to Alaska, Silverman and others said.
This bullseye has been difficult for local political analyst Nancy Sims and her 14-year-old transgender daughter to carry. Sims said her daughter was devastated when opponents aired their first ads.
""She was heartbroken and angry that people would think that because you're a transgender person that you are a sexual predator - which is the message they're sending,"" Sims said. ""It's been extremely difficult as a parent."" Opponents' targeted approach is the one they must take, said ACLU of Texas director Terri Burke, having been forced by growing acceptance to abandon anti-gay rhetoric.
That Hotze has been relatively muted on the issue of sexual orientation in recent months is in stark contrast to his approach when City Council passed the law 11-6 last year. While opponents were gathering thousands of signatures in an effort to force a repeal referendum, Hotze emailed conservative Steven Baer and cast the law as part of a ""tide of homosexual perversion sweeping over the country,"" according to emails obtained by the Chronicle.
Hotze, through Woodfill, declined to be interviewed for this story.
""Let's collaborate and join forces. Houston, Texas is ground zero on this issue,"" he wrote. ""We will repeal the pro-homosexual ordinance here and breath fire into the hearts of our brethren across Texas and the nation.""
That email is more consistent with Hotze's long record of fighting gay rights. In 1985, Hotze ran a so-called ""Straight Slate,"" organizing challengers to run against incumbent council members who supported job protections for gays employed by the city.
Smart strategy
Though none of the challengers won, Hotze had already succeeded in encouraging voters to repeal the protections. Hotze's clout among local conservatives continued to grow over the decades, with political hopefuls often vying for his endorsement and financial support.
This year, Hotze and fellow conservatives were accused of trying to reprise the ""Straight Slate,"" this time targeting council members who supported the equal rights ordinance. Woodfill denied there was such a coordinated effort but acknowledged he and others had ""encouraged people to run who oppose the bathroom ordinance.""
Hotze has contributed significantly to the campaign to defeat Proposition 1. The most recent campaign finance reports showed Hotze loaning the group $50,000 and buying $96,225 in radio ads. Woodfill said he believed but could not confirm that another $200,350 in credit card expenditures to purchase radio ads came from Hotze.
Hotze's less public role in the campaign is a smart strategy, said University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus.

10/26/15,18,Obits,LGBT rights groups look to Houston vote \ - Nondiscrimination measure seen as nationally significant ,"After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city -- seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 -- city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters. In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17, including New Jersey, prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure -- the Equality Act -- was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country -- it's not easy,"" said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts -- bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan -- backed by many major corporations -- to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities -- including Pence's hometown of Columbus -- recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter.

10/26/15,18,Metro,HOUSTON TO VOTE ON LGBT NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE ,"
After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with
2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance would consolidate bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in
2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.

Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city - seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 - city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT nondiscrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure - the Equality Act - was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country - it's not easy, said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts - bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass, said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan - backed by many major corporations - to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities - including Pence's hometown of Columbus - recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.

Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. ""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said. ""And we want to give them a perfect example of what a major, diverse city ought to look like.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,1188,90.96,50.59,39,21.25,20.48,31.9,80.72,56.82,45.54,6.31,2.44,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.42,0.51,3.87,15.32,8.67,2.53,14.56,6.9,3.28,4.8,0.84,12.37,6.48,4.12,7.41,2.1,1.09,4.46,9.68,0.76,8.75,1.01,1.18,1.26,1.01,0.84,3.11,0,2.95,1.52,1.43,1.09,0.25,0.84,0.25,0.51,0,0,11.78,5.47,0.42,0.17,1.52,0.42,1.6,5.13,0.17,0,0.93,0.17,4.12,4.04,0,0.08,3.45,0.08,0.67,1.43,0.17,1.18,2.27,0,0,0,0,0,2.1,0,0,0,0.17,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.17,1.26,0,3.11,10.1,0.34,1.6,8.16,0.42,0,0,4.12,3.54,4.21,1.09,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,20.29,5.81,6.48,0,0,1.94,6.06,0,0.25,0,0.08,0,0.25,3.38,3.47,3.17,3.51,2.81,-3.01,-1.26,0,-0.81,-1.1,0.59,0.76,0.08,0,0.76,0.67,0.76,0,0.51,0,0.84,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.77,1.02,17.58,193.6,1.52,252.53,0,67.34,0.51,252.53,2.02,75.76,-0.76,260.94,0.84,277.78,0,159.93,-0.17,75.76,0.42,42.09,0,67.34,227.27,117.85,33.67,25.25,101.01,0.34,67.34,84.18,16.84,33.67,0,0,0,84.18,33.67,84.18,58.92,33.67,8.42,0.34,1,0.67,1.01,0.08,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.51,0.17,0.17,0,1

10/25/15,18,Opinion,OUR VIEWPOINT: Proposition 1 on state ballot deserves support ,"The first of seven propositions on the statewide ballot Nov. 3 is one that deserves our support.
The measure would amend the Texas Constitution to increase property tax exemptions from $15,000 to $25,000, saving Texas homeowners an average of $126 a year on property tax bills.
That‚Äôs a welcome savings for property owners who have seen home values skyrocket in recent years.
Voters should not confuse Proposition 1 on the state ballot ‚Äî an increase in the property tax exemption ‚Äî with Houston‚Äôs controversial Proposition 1, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance known as HERO. That ordinance on the city ballot in Houston is not on any ballot we will see in Brazoria County.
Here, there is only the statewide Proposition 1, and despite concerns, the state is basically playing a shell game with funding rather than cutting spending, and that renters don‚Äôt get a share of the savings, Proposition 1 deserves widespread support and passage next month.
We encourage a vote for the measure, but that‚Äôs not to say we don‚Äôt have some concerns of our own.
First, though state lawmakers have promised they will make up for the loss of $600 million a year in tax revenues school districts will see as a result of the higher exemption, we have seen the Legislature fail to live up to its promises when it comes to school district funding before.
Second, there is no remedy included to stop the skyrocketing property values that have plagued some homeowners. An increase in the homestead exemption is only relief as long as your property value increase doesn‚Äôt close the savings gap over time.

10/25/15,18,B,"Commentary - Who's allowed in our bathrooms? Houston, we have bigger problems ","The TV screen flips to a grainy, otherworldly black and white.
You see images of burned-out buildings, boarded-up libraries, abandoned homes strewn with profane graffiti. Hollow-eyed homeless people roam the streets. There's a foreboding sense of disaster as the camera pans to the city limit sign, dangling and splotched with bullet holes.
Is it Detroit? Maybe Cleveland? Somewhere in godless California? No! It's ... Houston!
""That's right,"" a voice says in a post-apocalyptic growl, ""in a world of spiking debt payments and voter-imposed revenue caps, this will be Houston in 20 years if you don't elect a new mayor who will address the pension crisis!""
Cue the screams of frightened animals. OK, so this isn't a real TV ad.
It's the ad we'd see if the folks campaigning against the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance put their menacing imaginations to use for good, rather than evil.
Here our great city sits on the brink of financial ruin - fresh out of ingenious hat tricks and dexterous can-kicking to forestall the inevitable deficit, estimated at $126 million for next fiscal year. Over the summer, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Houston's general obligation debt outlook to ""negative."" The city is slated this year to make $350 million in pension payments, almost twice what it spends on trash pickup, parks and libraries. The Greater Houston Partnership and the Arnold Foundation, an influential think tank, have sounded the alarm in white papers.
Term-limited Mayor Annise Parker says the next administration may have to lay off more employees, ground police cars and fire trucks, and close parks and libraries. New monthly garbage fee, anyone?
Pension talk, as boring as it is, has been prominent among mayoral candidates. All of them, to some degree, support reform. Councilman Steve Costello and former Kemah Mayor Bill King have the most detailed proposed solutions, but neither seems to have the clout to bring stakeholders to the table, including the reluctant firefighters. Longtime state Rep. Sylvester Turner may have that clout, but endorsements by all three municipal employee unions might hamstring his ability to call for substantial change.
Public seems confused
No candidate will be able to call for anything pension-related without public support. And right now, the public seems confused or indifferent about the issue - or both. A poll conducted earlier this year by Rice University Professor Bob Stein found that barely
3 percent of registered voters listed city finances and pensions as a key issue.
Meanwhile, a bunch of people are up in arms about ... bathrooms.
A group calling itself ""Campaign for Houston"" is running a bone-chilling TV ad - in black and white, of course - with a racing violin soundtrack that features a young girl being followed into a public bathroom stall by a man in a plaid shirt. A woman's voice ominously warns: ""Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day."" Of course, harassing behavior as in the video is illegal, and subject to prosecution, whether voters decide to keep the HERO ordinance or not.
The ordinance - approved by council, challenged in court and now before voters on the ballot - was conceived as a way to ban discrimination locally without the need for a lengthy, expensive federal lawsuit. It offers protections on 15 different bases, including sex, race, age, military service, religion and pregnancy.
But opponents harp only on one: gender identity, which would allow transgender men and women to use the bathroom of their choosing. It also would offer them protection from being fired, for instance, for their identity. Jurisdictions across the nation have had similar ordinances for decades.
Good for culture wars
Locally, the ordinance is supported by influential business groups, such as the GHP, Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston.
""Discrimination of any kind is not a Houston value, it's bad for the people of our city and it's bad for our economy,"" the groups wrote in a joint statement.
Ah, but it's good for the culture wars.
""Absolutely godless,"" is how influential Second Baptist Pastor Ed Young describes the ordinance, along with ""totally deceptive"" and ""deadly.""
What a waste of good hyperbole.
What if we saved that for a deserving problem - city finances. Yes, I know: You yawn. You want to flip the channel back to the frightened girl in the bathroom stall.
But if eerie music and a black-and-white filter can make people believe sexual predators need council's permission to sneak into women's restrooms, maybe the same tools could rouse voters about Houston's alarming financial state.
Cue the mad violins and sinister voice.
The end of boomtown is near! It's a world of spiking pension bills, revenue caps and slumping sales tax revenue. Google some of the Chronicle's Mike Morris' stories on the city's financial crisis. Choose the candidate who might save us from ruin!
Houston is no Detroit, you say. No, not yet.
That fate - even if we do nothing to stem the bleeding - is decades away.

10/25/15,18,B,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR - Rehabilitating juveniles ,"Middle ground
Regarding ""Teen to stand trial as adult in shooting death"" (Page B1, Thursday), it is clear why young Alferis Coby is being charged as an adult. He is a continuing danger to the community, and he won't get the rehabilitation services that might help him in enough quantity or enough time in the juvenile justice system to be safely released back to the community.
But his background, as related in the article, says he is a child, a very immature child, probably psychologically damaged and not able to show remorse or empathy or not able to demonstrate any remorse or empathy to authority figures - although he may actually have these feelings deep in him.
There must be a better way than relegating him to the adult prison system. He will be warehoused for the 40 years he will probably receive as a sentence, probably guaranteeing he will not get any better psychologically. When he is released at age 56 or 36 with good-time, he will be an even better gang member/killer/robber than he is now.
However, I understand that there are really only two options for a judge and prosecutor - a short-term stay in an inadequate juvenile system or a long-term stay in an inadequate adult prison system focused on retribution.
It seems like there should be a middle ground somewhere, something that attempts to try to rehabilitate the young guy in enough time to actually work, some formal combination of rehabilitative confinement and retributive confinement. He will eventually be released no matter what; it is just what state of mind will he be in when released?
Walt Lind, Nassau Bay Janitors united
Regarding ""A new salvo in janitor battle"" (Page D1, Thursday), the campaign in Houston and Los Angeles was of momentous importance for American labor.
It taught labor folks that the ""unorganizable"" immigrants, working in precarious positions, could be organized if unions met them where they were and if union strategists figured out how to split the business community, pitting building owners against janitorial companies.
More than a decade later, these principles continue to underlie union organizing efforts. David Bensman, posted on HoustonChronicle.com
Chilly reception
Regarding ""Something's not so rotten in Denmark"" (Page B5, Tuesday), I am a socialist at heart but realize that a group of people, whether Pharisees, politburo or politicians, should not be deciding for others what to do with their money. While usually agreeing with Paul Krugman, I believe he erred in using Denmark as an example of a successful ""welfare state.""
The only thing more inhospitable than the climate of the Scandinavian nation is their government's attitude toward immigrants. While we may disagree about the number of people that should be allowed to immigrate and what should be done with those who unlawfully entered our country, most of us are happy to accept people born outside the United States coming here legally to pursue the ""American Dream.""

Rights to hunt and fish
Regarding Proposition 6, the right to hunt and fish constitutional amendment, PETA calls hunting a coward's pastime. Wayne Pacelle, CEO of the The Humane Society of the United States, said, ""If we could shut down all sport hunting in a moment, we would."" These are but two of the groups gunning to take away every American's right to hunt and fish. That's why voting ""yes"" on Proposition 6 is so important.
The Texas of today embraces the outdoor traditions of our forefathers, but that doesn't mean there won't be weak spots tomorrow. Just ask the dove hunters of Michigan who can't hunt doves in their home state because well-organized anti-hunter groups have beaten back every attempt to reinstate a dove season for more than 30 years. That's just one example.
The anti-hunting movement is far too committed to stop at the Rio Grande. Never mind the $4.1 billion hunters and anglers spend every year in the Lone Star State or the 65,993 families who depend on the outdoor industry for their livelihoods. And if it wasn't for the nearly $55 million hunters, anglers and target shooters contributed to Texas conservation projects last year then there wouldn't be much of the outdoors left.
You can be sure, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will still make decisions on bag limits, season lengths and license fees.
Rebecca Louviere, Hunting Policy Liaison for the National Rifle Association
HERO
Regarding ""Already covered"" letter to the editor (Page B10, Friday), there currently are no federal or Texas state laws that provide any protection for LGBT individuals in housing or employment.
In addition, the protections for the other classes in the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance are not easily challenged at the state and federal level, as they usually require hiring a lawyer and are therefore prohibitively expensive.
It is absolutely imperative that we stick to the facts in our discussion of the HERO ordinance.

Campus carry
Regarding ""Gun law has UT faculty seething"" (Page A1, Oct. 18), the campus carry bill would permit Texans with concealed handgun licenses to carry their weapons in buildings on state university and college campuses.
I am a student at the University of Houston-Downtown, and I would not feel safe knowing that a classmate may have a firearm and I'm sitting next to him or her.
Although I am all for protecting myself in any way possible while on campus, I believe only the professor should be the one carrying a firearm. Also, officials at state university and college campuses should have the choice to either allow firearms on campus or not.

10/25/15,18,State,LGBT issue on Houston ballot ,"
HOUSTON ‚Äî After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city soon will decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city ‚Äî seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 ‚Äî city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York soon will join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure ‚Äî the Equality Act ‚Äî was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country ‚Äî it's not easy,"" Warbelow said. ""These are educational efforts ‚Äî bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter.""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said. ""And we want to give them a perfect example of what a major, diverse city ought to look like.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1185,90.85,50.62,38.7,20.23,23.24,31.98,80.76,56.79,45.57,6.33,2.45,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.42,0.51,3.88,15.36,8.69,2.53,14.51,6.92,3.29,4.81,0.84,12.41,6.41,4.14,7.43,2.11,1.1,4.47,9.7,0.76,8.78,1.01,1.18,1.27,1.01,0.84,3.12,0,2.87,1.43,1.43,1.1,0.25,0.84,0.25,0.51,0,0,11.81,5.49,0.42,0.17,1.52,0.42,1.6,5.15,0.17,0,0.93,0.17,4.14,4.05,0,0.08,3.46,0.08,0.68,1.43,0.17,1.18,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,0,0,0.17,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.17,1.27,0,3.12,10.13,0.34,1.6,8.19,0.42,0,0,4.05,3.54,4.22,1.1,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.48,5.82,6.33,0,0,1.94,4.39,0,0.25,0,0.08,0,0.25,3.37,3.46,3.17,3.51,2.81,-2.99,-1.26,0,-0.81,-1.09,0.59,0.76,0.08,0,0.76,0.68,0.76,0,0.51,0,0.84,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.76,1.02,17.47,194.09,1.52,253.16,0,67.51,0.51,253.16,2.03,75.95,-0.76,261.6,0.84,278.48,0,151.9,-0.08,75.95,0.42,42.19,0,67.51,227.85,118.14,33.76,16.88,101.27,0.34,67.51,84.39,16.88,33.76,0,0,0,84.39,33.76,84.39,59.07,33.76,8.44,0.34,1,0.67,1.09,0.08,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.5,0.17,0.17,0,1

""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city ‚Äî seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 ‚Äî city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure ‚Äî the Equality Act ‚Äî was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country ‚Äî it's not easy,"" said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts ‚Äî bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. ""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said.

Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city ‚Äî seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 ‚Äî city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure ‚Äî the Equality Act ‚Äî was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country ‚Äî it's not easy,"" said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts ‚Äî bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. ""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said.

10/25/15,18,News,LGBT issue on Houston ballot,"HOUSTON ‚Äî After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city soon will decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.

""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city ‚Äî seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 ‚Äî city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York will soon join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure ‚Äî the Equality Act ‚Äî was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country ‚Äî it's not easy,"" said Sarah Warbelow. ""These are educational efforts ‚Äî bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said. ""And we want to give them a perfect example of what a major, diverse city ought to look like.""

10/25/15,18,Domestic News,Showdown in Houston over LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance ,"HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city will soon decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.

10/25/15,18,US News,'Bathroom predator' spin on Houston equal rights bill puts Texans in hot seat - Christian conservatives and LGBT rights activists battle in court and media ahead of 3 November vote on Proposition 1 ordinance ,"
Standing in front of an image of a ballpark and staring into the camera, the former Houston Astros baseball star Lance Berkman had an important message to impart. Not regarding the Astros‚Äô improbable march to the playoffs, but about men in women‚Äôs bathrooms.
‚ÄúI played professional baseball for 15 years but my family‚Äôs more important. My wife and I have four daughters and Proposition One will allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women‚Äôs bathrooms, showers and locker rooms,‚Äù the ex-slugger said.
Related: 'Papers to pee': Texas, Kentucky and Florida consider anti-transgender bills
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better to prevent this danger by closing women‚Äôs restrooms to men rather than waiting for a crime to happen. Join me to stop the violation of privacy and discrimination against women. Vote no on Proposition One. No men in women‚Äôs bathrooms, no boys in girls‚Äô showers or locker rooms.‚Äù
The man nicknamed Big Puma was referring to a question posed to Houstonians as part of the city‚Äôs mayoral election on 3 November: should the city keep its equal rights ordinance?
Voters will be asked: ‚ÄúAre you in favor of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Ord. No. 2014-530, which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual‚Äôs sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy?‚Äù
On the face of it, the law banning all kinds of discrimination hardly seems controversial ‚Äì especially not in the nation‚Äôs fourth-largest city, and one of its most diverse, where the three-term mayor is an openly lesbian Democrat. Especially not when more than 200 cities nationwide, including all the other major urban areas, Dallas among them, have passed similar laws.
Yet somehow, the ordinance, dubbed Hero, has triggered an 18-month battle waged in the courts and the media that has spanned allegations of suppressed religious freedom, petition-rigging and helping sexual predators, and turned a local issue into a national fight between Christian conservatives and LGBT rights activists.
Despite the ordinance‚Äôs wide scope, opponents have zeroed in on bathrooms, producing a creepy TV commercial that shows a girl about to be attacked in a restroom. ‚ÄúAny man at any time could enter a women‚Äôs bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt, even registered sex offenders,‚Äù warns the voiceover.
Above all, perhaps, it has underlined that in a year of remarkable progress for LGBT rights, the rearguard action remains dogged and vocal in some parts of the country. Not least in Texas, where there are no statewide non-discrimination protections for LGBT residents.
Houston‚Äôs city council passed the ordinance 11-6 in May last year. Amid protests by Republicans and church leaders, the mayor, Annise Parker, removed language stating that no business could deny a transgender person access to the restroom consistent with his or her gender identity.
This was not enough for a group that submitted a petition in a bid to force a repeal referendum, then sued after the city declared that it fell short of the required threshold because many signatures were invalid.
Then the city made a political misstep when it tried to subpoena sermons from anti-ordinance pastors, outraging the religious right and prompting Republican presidential hopeful Rand Paul to allude to the row during the first GOP debate last August. ‚ÄúWhen the government tries to invade the church to enforce its own opinion on marriage, that‚Äôs when it‚Äôs time to resist,‚Äù he said.
Ultimately, Hero ended up in the Texas supreme court, which in July ruled that it must be repealed or placed on a ballot.
With turnout expected to be low in next month‚Äôs election (early voting has already begun), both sides are trying to mobilise support in the knowledge that an effective PR campaign could be decisive.
One of the mayoral candidates, Ben Hall, is campaigning on a ‚Äúno men in women‚Äôs bathrooms or boys in girls‚Äô locker-rooms‚Äù platform.
Texas‚Äôs lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick ‚Äì the state‚Äôs second-most powerful politician ‚Äì echoed that stance, while in a sermon, Ed Young, senior pastor at one of the country‚Äôs biggest Baptist mega-churches, thumbed through a copy of the ordinance and said it opens up the city ‚Äúto something that I think is absolutely Godless‚Äù.
Proponents of the ordinance point out that sexual assault is, of course, already illegal in any situation, and the city has long had a law that specifically bans entering a restroom of the opposite sex with malicious intent. Nor is there any evidence of transgender people entering bathrooms to commit assault in other cities following the passage of similar laws.
They also argue that scrapping the ordinance would have a negative impact on the city‚Äôs image that might harm businesses, especially at a time when sports events will bring Houston national attention.
The city will host college basketball‚Äôs men‚Äôs Final Four next April and the Super Bowl in 2017. Yet Bob McNair, the owner of the NFL‚Äôs Houston Texans and a major GOP donor, gave $10,000 to the anti-Hero Campaign for Houston.
After a backlash, McNair said in a statement on Friday that he made the donation because he felt the ordinance needed ‚Äúa thoughtful rewrite‚Äù and asked for the money back after Campaign for Houston ‚Äúmade numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to Hero‚Äù. He said that he does not ‚Äúbelieve in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind‚Äù.
Ellen Cohen, a council member in favour, said that the ordinance is backed by a wide range of business groups and that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a ‚ÄòGLBT equal rights bill‚Äô ‚Äì it‚Äôs a bill that includes the GLBT community ... the issue is equal rights for all. I think that if people are looking to find a reason [to fight it] then it becomes a bathroom issue.‚Äù
Earlier this year, Texas state lawmakers unsuccessfully proposed a raft of ‚Äúbathroom bills‚Äù, which would have criminalised transgender people for not using the restroom that comports with their biological sex at birth. Other states have tried similar measures.
Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that the tide is turning in favour of equal rights and that the Houston conflict is ‚Äúa death rattle‚Äù for opponents. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quickly becoming an average person thing versus a radical person thing. We‚Äôre not the radicals any more,‚Äù she said.
Still, given Houston‚Äôs size and influence, some activists worry that if the ‚Äúbathroom predators‚Äù spin is persuasive, such fear- mongering could be used as a blueprint in other large cities where there are people who want to frustrate or repeal equal-rights provisions.
‚ÄúCertainly the tactic was used in Fayetteville, Anchorage, and other cities. If it works here, if Hero is defeated, the bathroom argument will gain steam,‚Äù said Daniel Williams of Equality Texas, an LGBT rights group. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the numbers on our side. All they‚Äôve got is a very scary line.‚Äù",Campaign for Houston ,1,1156,89.88,39.56,39.79,10.73,23.59,26.47,83.13,58.3,46.11,6.83,2.25,0.69,0.26,0.09,0.69,0.35,4.58,17.13,9.86,1.47,12.89,5.88,3.11,5.1,1.56,11.94,5.88,4.15,6.83,1.21,0.87,4.76,13.06,1.38,11.68,1.47,1.64,1.3,2.51,0.61,4.76,0,4.24,1.64,2.6,1.04,0.09,0.95,0.43,0.52,0,0,13.58,6.06,0.61,0.09,1.64,0.69,1.99,6.57,0.52,0,1.47,1.47,3.11,2.85,0.17,0.09,3.98,0.69,0.52,1.47,0.69,0.87,1.82,0.09,0,0,0,0,1.12,0,0.09,0.17,0.17,0.26,0.35,0,0,0.09,0.43,0.09,3.46,9,0.35,1.04,7.01,0.35,0.09,0.09,3.72,3.89,3.46,1.04,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,20.16,4.24,7.44,0.17,0,3.11,5.19,0,0.35,0,0.26,0.09,0.09,3.81,3.99,3.42,3.67,3.17,-3.76,-2.13,-1.13,-1.63,-2.47,0.43,0.26,0.09,0.52,1.64,0.35,0.52,0,0.35,0.09,0.69,0.35,1.12,0.09,0.26,0,0,0.09,0,0,0,0.09,0,0,1.62,1.61,17.01,86.51,0.52,276.82,-0.09,155.71,1.21,164.36,1.21,86.51,-0.69,250.87,0.78,302.77,0,103.81,0,77.85,0.61,17.3,0,25.95,155.71,103.81,51.9,17.3,147.06,0.17,138.41,138.41,8.65,43.25,0,0,0,103.81,17.3,138.41,77.85,69.2,0,1.3,1,0.33,0.74,0.17,0,0.17,0.08,0.25,0,0.33,0,0.33,0,1
10/25/15,18,B,"Commentary - Who's allowed in our bathrooms? Houston, we have bigger problems ","The TV screen flips to a grainy, otherworldly black and white.
You see images of burned-out buildings, boarded-up libraries, abandoned homes strewn with profane graffiti. Hollow-eyed homeless people roam the streets. There's a foreboding sense of disaster as the camera pans to the city limit sign, dangling and splotched with bullet holes.
Is it Detroit? Maybe Cleveland? Somewhere in godless California? No! It's ... Houston!
""That's right,"" a voice says in a post-apocalyptic growl, ""in a world of spiking debt payments and voter-imposed revenue caps, this will be Houston in 20 years if you don't elect a new mayor who will address the pension crisis!""
Cue the screams of frightened animals. OK, so this isn't a real TV ad.
It's the ad we'd see if the folks campaigning against the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance put their menacing imaginations to use for good, rather than evil.
Here our great city sits on the brink of financial ruin - fresh out of ingenious hat tricks and dexterous can-kicking to forestall the inevitable deficit, estimated at $126 million for next fiscal year. Over the summer, the credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Houston's general obligation debt outlook to ""negative."" The city is slated this year to make $350 million in pension payments, almost twice what it spends on trash pickup, parks and libraries. The Greater Houston Partnership and the Arnold Foundation, an influential think tank, have sounded the alarm in white papers.
Term-limited Mayor Annise Parker says the next administration may have to lay off more employees, ground police cars and fire trucks, and close parks and libraries. New monthly garbage fee, anyone?
Pension talk, as boring as it is, has been prominent among mayoral candidates. All of them, to some degree, support reform. Councilman Steve Costello and former Kemah Mayor Bill King have the most detailed proposed solutions, but neither seems to have the clout to bring stakeholders to the table, including the reluctant firefighters. Longtime state Rep. Sylvester Turner may have that clout, but endorsements by all three municipal employee unions might hamstring his ability to call for substantial change.
Public seems confused
No candidate will be able to call for anything pension-related without public support. And right now, the public seems confused or indifferent about the issue - or both. A poll conducted earlier this year by Rice University Professor Bob Stein found that barely
3 percent of registered voters listed city finances and pensions as a key issue.
Meanwhile, a bunch of people are up in arms about ... bathrooms.
A group calling itself ""Campaign for Houston"" is running a bone-chilling TV ad - in black and white, of course - with a racing violin soundtrack that features a young girl being followed into a public bathroom stall by a man in a plaid shirt. A woman's voice ominously warns: ""Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day."" Of course, harassing behavior as in the video is illegal, and subject to prosecution, whether voters decide to keep the HERO ordinance or not.
The ordinance - approved by council, challenged in court and now before voters on the ballot - was conceived as a way to ban discrimination locally without the need for a lengthy, expensive federal lawsuit. It offers protections on 15 different bases, including sex, race, age, military service, religion and pregnancy.
But opponents harp only on one: gender identity, which would allow transgender men and women to use the bathroom of their choosing. It also would offer them protection from being fired, for instance, for their identity. Jurisdictions across the nation have had similar ordinances for decades.
Good for culture wars
Locally, the ordinance is supported by influential business groups, such as the GHP, Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Hotel and Lodging Association of Greater Houston.
""Discrimination of any kind is not a Houston value, it's bad for the people of our city and it's bad for our economy,"" the groups wrote in a joint statement.
Ah, but it's good for the culture wars.
""Absolutely godless,"" is how influential Second Baptist Pastor Ed Young describes the ordinance, along with ""totally deceptive"" and ""deadly.""
What a waste of good hyperbole.
What if we saved that for a deserving problem - city finances. Yes, I know: You yawn. You want to flip the channel back to the frightened girl in the bathroom stall.
But if eerie music and a black-and-white filter can make people believe sexual predators need council's permission to sneak into women's restrooms, maybe the same tools could rouse voters about Houston's alarming financial state.
Cue the mad violins and sinister voice.
The end of boomtown is near! It's a world of spiking pension bills, revenue caps and slumping sales tax revenue. Google some of the Chronicle's Mike Morris' stories on the city's financial crisis. Choose the candidate who might save us from ruin!
Houston is no Detroit, you say. No, not yet.
That fate - even if we do nothing to stem the bleeding - is decades away.

10/25/15,18,State,LGBT issue on Houston ballot ,"
HOUSTON ‚Äî After a drawn-out showdown between Houston's popular lesbian mayor and a coalition of conservative pastors, voters in the nation's fourth-largest city soon will decide whether to establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people.
Nationwide, there's interest in the Nov. 3 referendum: Confrontations over the same issue are flaring in many places, at the state and local level, now that nondiscrimination has replaced same-sex marriage as the No. 1 priority for the LGBT-rights movement.
""The vote in Houston will carry national significance,"" said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT-rights group. She noted that Houston, with 2.2 million residents, is more populous than 15 states.
The contested Houston Equal Rights Ordinance is a broad measure that would consolidate existing bans on discrimination tied to race, sex, religion and other categories in employment, housing and public accommodations, and extend such protections to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people.
The outcome is considered uncertain. Two recent polls commissioned by Houston TV stations showed supporters of the ordinance with a slight lead, but each poll indicated that about one-fifth of likely voters were undecided.
Opponents contend the ordinance would infringe on their religious beliefs against homosexuality. Copying a tactic used elsewhere, they also have labeled it the ""bathroom ordinance,"" alleging that it would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" says an ad produced by Campaign for Houston, which opposes the ordinance.
The measure's supporters denounce these assertions as scare tactics, arguing that such problems with public bathrooms have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states that have banned discrimination based on gender identity.
Mayor Annise Parker, whose election in 2009 made Houston the largest U.S. city with an openly gay mayor, is among those expressing exasperation.
""The fact there is so much misinformation and not just misinformation, just out and out ludicrous lies, is very frustrating,"" Parker recently told reporters. ""I'm worried about the image of Houston around the world as a tolerant, welcoming place if this goes down.""
Parker has vented some of her frustration on Twitter in tweets criticizing former Houston Astros player Lance Berkman. In ads for Campaign for Houston, Berkman said the ordinance would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, has encountered criticism herself. When opponents sued the city ‚Äî seeking to force a referendum on the ordinance after the city council approved it in May 2014 ‚Äî city attorneys tried to subpoena sermons from five pastors who opposed the measure. The pastors said the request violated their religious freedom, and the city later dropped the effort.
The lawsuit eventually reached the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ruled the conservative activists should have succeeded in their petition drive to put the issue before voters.
In a sermon last month, Ed Young, pastor of Second Baptist Church, one of the nation's largest churches, called the ordinance ""totally deceptive"" and urged his congregation to vote against it because ""it will carry our city ... further down the road of being totally, in my opinion, secular and godless.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, which supports the ordinance, said the measure is not simply about anti- LGBT discrimination but about multiple forms of bias. Between May 2014 and September 2015, most discrimination complaints in the city related to race and gender; only about 5 percent involved LGBT discrimination.
Several national LGBT-rights groups have deployed staff in Houston to support the ordinance, including Freedom for All Americans. Its CEO, Matt McTighe, praised Houston's cultural diversity, but said it was the only one of the 10 largest U.S. cities without LGBT non-discrimination protection.
For years, the top priority of the gay-rights movement in the U.S. was winning nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage. When that occurred via a Supreme Court ruling in June, there was broad agreement among activists that the next priority should be obtaining nondiscrimination protections in all 50 states.
At present, Texas is one of 28 states with no statewide protections, although many municipalities in those states have adopted local nondiscrimination policies. Of the other 22 states, 17 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and New York soon will join that group. Four states have less sweeping protections.
LGBT activists would like to replace this patchwork of laws with a comprehensive federal nondiscrimination law, and such a measure ‚Äî the Equality Act ‚Äî was introduced in July. But it's given no chance of passage in the current Republican-controlled Congress; none of its more than 200 co-sponsors are from the GOP.
Faced with that reality, LGBT-rights supporters are waging a state-by-state, city-by-city campaign to extend anti-bias protections.
""We're now at a moment where we're having conversations with more conservative parts of the country ‚Äî it's not easy,"" Warbelow said. ""These are educational efforts ‚Äî bringing people along on what it means to provide protections for the LGBT community and helping people understand that the sky doesn't fall when you do that.""
At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter.""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said.

At the state level, activists consider Pennsylvania the most likely to join in establishing statewide protections.
LGBT nondiscrimination has been on the Pennsylvania legislature's agenda for more than a decade but there's never been a floor vote, largely due to Republican opposition. Now there's growing GOP support for the latest measure, introduced in August, and supporters believe it will prevail if skeptics can be assured it won't erode religious liberties.
""I'm confident that if this bill is given a vote in the Senate and House, it will pass,"" said state Sen. Pat Browne, a lead Republican sponsor. ""The people we represent believe this is something we should do.""
In Indiana, prospects are unclear for a Democratic plan ‚Äî backed by many major corporations ‚Äî to push for statewide LGBT protections. The topic has been divisive since the spring, when Republican Gov. Mike Pence and the GOP-controlled Legislature incurred a backlash for a religious objections law that critics said would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.
In the absence of a statewide law, several smaller Indiana cities ‚Äî including Pence's hometown of Columbus ‚Äî recently joined Indianapolis and Bloomington in adopting local LGBT protections. Similar efforts failed in the cities of Goshen and Elkhart.
There's been action recently in several other states. In September, Fayetteville became the fifth Arkansas municipality to pass an LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance in defiance of a new state law aimed at prohibiting such local protections. In Alaska's largest city, the governing assembly of Anchorage passed an ordinance Sept. 29 by a 9-2 vote. In Arizona, an ordinance was approved in Sedona.
Other cities across the U.S. will be watching Houston on Nov. 3, said James Douglas, a supporter of the ordinance who is president of Houston's NAACP chapter. ""All those cities that are smaller than us are looking to us because they want to be like us,"" Douglas said. ""And we want to give them a perfect example of what a major, diverse city ought to look like.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,1186,90.85,50.61,38.61,20.23,20.45,31.96,80.69,56.75,45.53,6.32,2.45,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.42,0.51,3.88,15.35,8.68,2.53,14.5,6.91,3.29,4.81,0.84,12.39,6.41,4.13,7.42,2.11,1.1,4.47,9.7,0.76,8.77,1.01,1.18,1.26,1.01,0.84,3.12,0,2.87,1.43,1.43,1.1,0.25,0.84,0.25,0.51,0,0,11.8,5.48,0.42,0.17,1.52,0.42,1.6,5.14,0.17,0,0.93,0.17,4.13,4.05,0,0.08,3.46,0.08,0.67,1.43,0.17,1.18,2.28,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,0,0,0,0.17,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.17,1.26,0,3.12,10.12,0.34,1.6,8.18,0.42,0,0,4.05,3.54,4.22,1.1,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.47,5.82,6.32,0,0,1.94,4.38,0,0.25,0,0.08,0,0.25,3.37,3.46,3.17,3.5,2.81,-2.99,-1.26,0,-0.81,-1.09,0.59,0.76,0.08,0,0.76,0.67,0.76,0,0.51,0,0.84,0.25,0.76,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.76,1.02,17.45,193.93,1.52,252.95,0,67.45,0.51,252.95,2.02,75.89,-0.76,261.38,0.84,278.25,0,151.77,-0.08,75.89,0.42,42.16,0,67.45,227.66,118.04,33.73,16.86,101.18,0.34,67.45,84.32,16.86,33.73,0,0,0,84.32,33.73,84.32,59.02,33.73,8.43,0.34,1,0.67,1.09,0.08,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.5,0.17,0.17,0,1

10/24/15,18,B,EDITORIAL - McNair stands up - Texans owner sets a brave example by rescinding support from anti-HERO group. ,"There are no instant replays in real life, but Texans owner Bob McNair got pretty close on Friday when he rescinded his $10,000 contribution to a group opposing Houston's embattled Equal Rights Ordinance. These are his words, in a written statement: ""To my great dismay, Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast and social media ‚Äã- including attributing certain statements of belief to me. Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me. Therefore I instructed the Campaign to return my contribution.""
McNair is no stranger to conservative political causes. He's donated more than $3 million to Republican groups since 2009. But Campaign for Houston, which opposes the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, crossed a line for the Texans owner, and on Friday he threw the flag. ""I do not believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind,"" McNair continued. ""I also believe we Houstonians should have an ordinance that unites our community and provides a bold statement of non-discrimination. . . .""
McNair apparently came to realize what this editorial page and other HERO proponents have been saying all along - that is, the virulent opposition to HERO is not based on facts about the ordinance but on the opponents' disdain for the growing social acceptance of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Houstonians. That opposition is so virulent, in fact, that Dr. Steven Hotze, Jared Woodfill and others leading the charge against the ordinance have resorted to a campaign of lies, distortion and fear- mongering. It's a campaign that deserves to be flushed down a toilet in one of those bathrooms prominently featured in their misleading ads.
The Texans owner no doubt recognizes dirty play when he sees it. Many of his fellow Houstonians, we suspect, are coming to the same awareness, regardless of whether they're completely comfortable with the ordinance. Legitimate opposition is one thing; foul play is another.
With his decision to rescind his donation, Bob McNair shows yet again that he and his Texans care about the well-being of this city. We salute him, and we urge Houstonians to keep his example in mind when they go to the polls Nov. 3.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,364,67.86,48.21,30.98,27.51,20.22,28.57,81.04,60.99,50.27,12.91,8.24,2.2,1.37,0,3.57,1.1,4.67,15.93,6.32,1.92,14.56,5.49,4.4,6.59,1.92,10.99,5.22,3.02,8.52,2.47,0.27,6.04,14.29,1.1,12.91,2.75,1.92,0.82,1.65,1.1,5.22,0,6.59,3.57,3.02,1.37,0.55,0.82,0.27,0.27,0,0,18.41,9.07,1.37,0,1.92,1.37,1.92,9.34,0,0,0.27,3.57,2.75,2.2,0,0.55,1.92,0.55,0,0.82,0.55,0,1.37,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0.82,0,0,0,0,0.55,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,3.3,6.59,0.27,1.65,4.95,0.55,0,0,3.02,2.47,4.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.31,6.04,5.77,0,0,1.37,4.12,0,1.1,0,0,0.27,0,2.97,3.35,3.09,3.22,2.62,-2.19,-0.85,0.82,-0.53,0.12,0.55,0.27,0.27,0,1.1,0.55,1.37,0,0,0,0,0.55,0.55,0.27,0.82,0.27,0,0.27,0,0,0,0.27,0,0,3.18,2.39,15.85,329.67,1.65,521.98,0.82,82.42,0.55,302.2,1.65,82.42,-0.82,137.36,0.82,357.14,0,137.36,0.27,0,0,82.42,0,82.42,27.47,247.25,0,0,192.31,0.55,109.89,54.95,27.47,137.36,27.47,0.27,0,27.47,0,164.84,82.42,82.42,0,0.27,1,0.27,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0.27,0,1
10/24/15,18,B,McNair rescinds anti-HERO donation - Texans owner says he would support a 'less divisive' law ,"Texans owner Bob McNair has asked opponents of the city's controversial equal rights ordinance to return a $10,000 donation he made last week to the group, according to a statement.
McNair, a noted GOP donor and billionaire, said in a lengthy written statement Friday that, ""to my great dismay, Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO.""
But while it was clear McNair did not appreciate the publicity the campaign gave to his donation, his stance on the ordinance headed to voters next month appeared unchanged.
""I recently made a personal contribution to Campaign for Houston because my thorough review of the HERO ordinance led me to believe that a thoughtful rewrite would provide a better ordinance that would provide strong non-discrimination protections for all Houstonians, which I would support and would be less divisive of our city,"" he said in the statement.
Check won't be cashed
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for the Campaign for Houston, said the group handled McNair's donation appropriately. The campaign publicly announced the donation last week, using it to refute the supporters' claim that repealing the law could jeopardize Houston's 2017 Super Bowl gig; McNair's statement the next day, however, made no mention of that issue.
Woodfill attributed McNair's decision to rescind the check to national backlash. He said the campaign would not cash the check from McNair.
""Anytime you're high-profile and you take a stance on this issue you get attacked,"" Woodfill said. ""But we appreciate the original donation, and we believe, from his statement, that his opinion on the ordinance has not changed.""
Critics of the law, mostly conservatives, object to the nondiscrimination protections extending to gay and transgender residents and claim it would allow men into women's restrooms. The ordinance also bans discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
'Taking a step back'
The ordinance is applicable to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
A campaign manager for Houston Unites, the pro-HERO group, cheered McNair's decision.
""Like Bob McNair, many Houstonians are taking a step back and realizing the opposition's ads on the Equal Rights Ordinance are intended to raise anxiety with outright distortions and quite frankly lies,"" said Richard Carlbom. ""When you take a second look, the Equal Rights Ordinance protects all Houstonians from discrimination and makes Houston a place everyone can be proud to call home.""",Houston Unites,1,424,88.17,63.78,10.87,37.16,23.56,32.31,79.48,54.72,41.51,7.78,4.72,1.42,0.71,0.94,1.65,0,3.07,15.09,9.67,1.18,10.85,5.42,2.12,4.95,1.18,12.74,4.48,3.3,8.02,2.12,0.47,5.42,12.97,0.94,12.03,2.59,3.3,2.12,0.94,0.24,2.83,0,4.01,2.59,1.42,1.42,0.94,0.47,0.24,0,0,0,17.69,10.14,2.36,0,1.42,0.47,2.59,7.78,0.24,0,0.24,2.12,2.59,2.36,0.24,0,5.9,0.47,0.71,1.65,2.83,0.47,0.94,0.24,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,1.18,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,3.54,4.95,0.47,1.18,3.3,0.71,0,0,3.77,4.48,2.83,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,20.75,4.25,9.2,0,0,3.07,4.25,0,0.71,0.24,0,0,0.24,3.61,4.07,3.49,3.74,2.89,-2.54,-1.16,0.17,-0.15,-1.36,0.71,0.71,0,0.24,1.89,0.47,1.18,0,0.71,0,0.47,0,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.1,0.94,17.48,212.26,1.65,377.36,0.71,141.51,0.47,141.51,0.94,141.51,-0.47,353.77,1.42,518.87,0,0,0,47.17,0.47,70.75,0,23.58,117.92,117.92,70.75,0,47.17,0.47,212.26,70.75,23.58,47.17,0,0,0,94.34,47.17,141.51,47.17,23.58,0,0.71,1,0.47,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0.24,0.24,0,1

10/24/15,18,B,LETTERS TO THE EDITOR ,"Statement on HERO
I recently made a personal contribution to Campaign for Houston because my thorough review of the HERO ordinance led me to believe that a thoughtful rewrite would provide a better ordinance that would provide strong nondiscrimination protections for all Houstonians, which I would support, and would be less divisive of our city.
It was on these principles that I made my personal contribution to Campaign for Houston. To my great dismay, Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast and social media - including attributing certain statements of belief to me. Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me. Therefore, I instructed the Campaign to return my contribution.
I do not believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind. I also believe that we Houstonians should have an ordinance that unites our community and provides a bold statement of nondiscrimination. I encourage all Houstonians to vote on Nov. 3.
Robert F. Kennedy once said, ""Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work together to change a small portion of events, and in the total of those acts will be written the history of our generation.""
Robert C. McNair Taxing reality
Regarding ""Forced by cap, Houston cuts tax rate again"" (Page A1, Thursday), once again city officials whine their budget can only be increased by 4.5 percent. There are many families in this area, living on stagnant wages, which would jump for joy at a 4.5 percent pay raise.
Given this lack of wage increases, what must the average family do when faced with rising prices and stagnant incomes? They cut their expenses. Why can't governments do the same? Companies must constantly pare expenses in the face of rising prices where consumers have the option to purchase their goods and services. We have no such choice when it comes to our tax bills; we must pay them or forfeit our homes.
It is long past time for property tax reform in this state, and if our elected officials fail to act soon, the allure of affordable housing in Texas will be the thing of our past. Annual tax bills for some residents will soon surpass their mortgage payments, if they have not already.

10/23/15,18,Front,Perverse campaign against gay rights ,"HE BATTLE OVER Houston's nondiscrimination law took a real ugly turn last week when opponents aired one of the most outrageous and disgustingly deceptive ads in their effort to repeal it at the ballot box in November.
Even though the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance protects 15 different characteristics from discrimination in Texas's largest city, those who want to kill the legislation are focused on only one of them: gender identity. And they are ginning up support and misinformed hysteria by calling it ""the bathroom ordinance.""
Take a look at the ad from an outfit called the Campaign for Houston. The last frame is as terrifying as the entire ad is flat-out false.
Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt; even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, and if a business tried to stop them they'd be fined. Protect women's privacy. Prevent danger. Vote ""no"" on the Proposition 1 ""bathroom ordinance."" It goes too far.
What goes too far is this bigoted ad and its perversion of the facts. It is an outright lie to say ""any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day.""
Such a statement reveals a willful ignorance of what it means to be transgender. In addition, the so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" people completely ignore a rather specific Houston law that has been on the books since 1972.
According to Code 1968, ¬ß 28-42.6; Ord. No. 72-904, ¬ß 2, 6-2-72 , ""It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance."" In short, if you're in the bathroom for any purpose other than relieving yourself, you're breaking the law. And if you're in there to molest children or commit rape, you're also a monster.
Due to a legal challenge to HERO, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the Houston city council to repeal the law or put it up for popular vote this November. The straightforward question asks whether the law should go into effect.
""Are you in favor of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Ord. No. 2014-530, which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy?""
HERO foes ignore the fact that nine other Texas cities with more than 100,000 already have anti-discrimination laws on the books. According to Texas Monthly, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin have had them ""for at least a decade."" Space City isn't breaking new ground here.
That there is such a pitched battle over the Houston statute is further proof that the fight for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans did not end with the Supreme Court's marriage-equality ruling in June. And it makes clear that opponents will stop at nothing to ensure that full equality never comes.
Last week, Samantha Power received an award from the Council for Global Equality. The group, which pushes to have American foreign policy inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, presented the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations with its Global Equality Leadership Award. While Power's remarks had nothing to do with Houston, the sentiment they expressed definitely applied. ""If we are horrified by Power then added this: ""We are all striving to create respect for LGBT rights in those countries because we are not willing to accept a world where basic human rights can only be enjoyed in constricted places. Whether that place is a home or a neighborhood or a state or a country. There can't be no-go zones for these rights to be real.""
If the voters of Houston reject Proposition 1, they will create a no-go zone for LGBT people.

Even though the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance protects 15 different characteristics from discrimination in Texas's largest city, those who want to kill the legislation are focused on only one of them: gender identity. And they are ginning up support and misinformed hysteria by calling it ""the bathroom ordinance.""
Take a look at the ad from an outfit called the Campaign for Houston. The last frame is as terrifying as the entire ad is flat-out false.
Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt; even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, and if a business tried to stop them they'd be fined. Protect women's privacy. Prevent danger. Vote ""no"" on the Proposition 1 ""bathroom ordinance."" It goes too far.
What goes too far is this bigoted ad and its perversion of the facts. It is an outright lie to say ""any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day.""
Such a statement reveals a willful ignorance of what it means to be transgender. In addition, the so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" people completely ignore a rather specific Houston law that has been on the books since 1972.
According to Code 1968, ¬ß 28-42.6; Ord. No. 72-904, ¬ß 2, 6-2-72 , ""It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance."" In short, if you're in the bathroom for any purpose other than relieving yourself, you're breaking the law. And if you're in there to molest children or commit rape, you're also a monster.
Due to a legal challenge to HERO, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the Houston city council to repeal the law or put it up for popular vote this November. The straightforward question asks whether the law should go into effect.
""Are you in favor of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Ord. No. 2014-530, which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy?""
HERO foes ignore the fact that nine other Texas cities with more than 100,000 already have anti-discrimination laws on the books. According to Texas Monthly, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin have had them ""for at least a decade."" Space City isn't breaking new ground here.
That there is such a pitched battle over the Houston statute is further proof that the fight for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans did not end with the Supreme Court's marriage-equality ruling in June. And it makes clear that opponents will stop at nothing to ensure that full equality never comes.
Last week, Samantha Power received an award from the Council for Global Equality. The group, which pushes to have American foreign policy inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, presented the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations with its Global Equality Leadership Award. While Power's remarks had nothing to do with Houston, the sentiment they expressed definitely applied.""If we are horrified by Power then added this: ""We are all striving to create respect for LGBT rights in those countries because we are not willing to accept a world where basic human rights can only be enjoyed in constricted places. Whether that place is a home or a neighborhood or a state or a country. There can't be no-go zones for these rights to be real.""
If the voters of Houston reject Proposition 1, they will create a no-go zone for LGBT people. And they better be prepared for the backlash that will result.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,705,87.45,46.78,41.11,12.76,19.05,23.83,85.53,60.14,48.09,7.09,2.7,0,0.43,0.85,0,1.28,4.4,15.89,9.36,2.13,13.62,6.81,3.26,5.67,1.56,11.49,6.38,3.26,6.38,0.57,1.28,4.54,12.62,1.28,11.21,0.71,1.7,0.99,3.4,0.85,5.39,0,4.82,1.99,2.7,0.85,0.14,0.57,0.28,0.14,0,0,13.48,5.82,0.57,0,1.84,1.7,0.71,6.81,0.43,0,1.13,0.28,3.26,2.98,0.28,0,2.98,0,0.57,2.13,0.28,0.14,2.27,0.14,0,0,0,0,1.84,0,0.14,0,0.28,0.57,0,0.14,0,0.28,0.57,0.28,3.69,8.94,0.71,1.42,6.67,0.57,0,0,3.69,1.84,4.11,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,19.29,5.67,6.38,0.14,0,2.27,4.82,0,0.14,0.14,0.43,0,0,3.98,4.31,3.36,3.67,3.54,-3.56,-1.92,-0.42,-1.58,-1.77,0.43,0.43,0.14,0.57,2.41,0.43,0.71,0,1.56,0.14,0.14,0.43,1.99,0.28,0.57,0,0.14,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.52,1.58,18.6,113.48,0.85,368.79,-0.57,141.84,0.28,141.84,0.99,85.11,-0.57,312.06,0.28,382.98,0,56.74,0,42.55,0.43,0,0,56.74,170.21,56.74,0,28.37,113.48,0,170.21,156.03,14.18,14.18,14.18,-0.14,0,127.66,70.92,170.21,127.66,70.92,0,0.57,1,1.13,1.13,0.57,0,0,0.28,0.28,0,0.28,0.14,0.28,0,1

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) ‚Äî Houston Texans owner Bob McNair on Friday rescinded a $10,000 donation to conservatives hoping to repeal nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgendered residents in the city, saying the campaign made ""unauthorized statements"" about his beliefs.
McNair, a major Republican political donor, didn't specify what comments made by the Campaign for Houston caused him ""great dismay."" Nor did his statement, released through the Texans, denounce the aims of the group that has sought to rally voters with a ""No Men in Women's Bathrooms"" slogan.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO, makes no reference to public bathrooms and supporters say the claim is designed to mislead voters ahead of the Nov. 3 referendum.
""Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast and social media - including attributing certain statements of belief to me,"" McNair said. ""Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me.""
Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for the campaign, said he did not know what the NFL owner was referencing but said the money would be returned.
""We've never spoken for him. We don't speak for him. We are just thankful for the support he gave us,"" Woodfill said. Former Houston Astros star Lance Berkman also opposes the ordinance and has filmed an ad for the campaign.
The ordinance, passed last year by the Houston City Council, bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the nation's fourth-largest city. It aims to protect gay and transgender people against discrimination in employment and public places.
Conservative activists said voters, not councilmembers, should decide whether Houston has such an ordinance and succeeded in a petition drive to put the question on a ballot. Mayor Annise Parker and other defenders of the law say a repeal would damage the reputation of the city, which hosts the 2017 Super Bowl.
McNair said he doesn't tolerate discrimination of any kind and believes the city could rewrite a stronger ordinance that would give protections for ""all Houstonians.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,337,91.07,50.67,5.89,42.19,19.82,27,79.23,56.97,43.62,6.53,4.75,0.89,1.19,0,2.37,0.3,1.78,13.95,10.09,1.19,13.35,5.64,1.78,5.04,3.26,14.24,4.15,1.19,8.31,1.78,0.89,5.64,11.87,1.48,10.39,2.37,2.37,1.78,0.89,0,3.56,0,3.26,2.37,0.89,0.89,0.59,0.3,0,0,0,0,19.58,10.98,0.89,0,1.48,0.59,4.75,8.31,0,0,0.3,3.26,4.75,4.15,0,0.59,2.97,1.19,0.3,1.19,0.3,0,1.48,0,0,0,0,0,0.89,0,0,0,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.3,1.19,0,2.97,5.04,0.3,1.19,3.86,0,0,0,1.78,7.42,2.97,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,18.1,5.04,5.64,0,0,1.78,5.64,0,0.59,0,0,0,0.3,3.67,4.02,3.42,3.67,3.12,-3.39,-0.66,0.59,-0.83,-1.13,0.3,0.89,0,0.3,0.89,1.19,0.3,0,0.3,0,0,0.3,0.59,0,0.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.3,0.3,0,2.13,1.24,13.55,89.02,0.89,415.43,1.19,148.37,0.59,118.69,1.19,0,0,296.74,2.08,385.76,0,148.37,0.3,0,0,29.67,0,59.35,178.04,59.35,0,0,59.35,0.3,59.35,59.35,0,29.67,0,0,0,29.67,29.67,118.69,89.02,59.35,0,0.89,1,0.89,2.07,0,0,0,0,0.3,1.48,0.89,0.59,0.3,0,1

10/23/15,18,na,NFL: NFL owner rescinds $10K opposition to nondiscrimination law ,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) Houston Texans owner Bob McNair on Friday rescinded a $10,000 donation to conservatives hoping to repeal nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgendered residents in the city, saying the campaign made ''unauthorized statements'' about his beliefs.
McNair, a major Republican political donor, didn't specify what comments made by the Campaign for Houston caused him ''great dismay.'' Nor did his statement, released through the Texans, denounce the aims of the group that has sought to rally voters with a ''No Men in Women's Bathrooms'' slogan.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO, makes no reference to public bathrooms and supporters say the claim is designed to mislead voters ahead of the Nov. 3 referendum.
''Campaign for Houston made numerous unauthorized statements about my opposition to HERO in print, broadcast and social media - including attributing certain statements of belief to me,'' McNair said. ''Their actions and statements were never discussed with nor approved by me.''
Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for the campaign, said he did not know what the NFL owner was referencing but said the money would be returned.
''We've never spoken for him. We don't speak for him. We are just thankful for the support he gave us,'' Woodfill said. Former Houston Astros star Lance Berkman also opposes the ordinance and has filmed an ad for the campaign.
The ordinance, passed last year by the Houston City Council, bans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in the nation's fourth-largest city. It aims to protect gay and transgender people against discrimination in employment and public places.
Conservative activists said voters, not councilmembers, should decide whether Houston has such an ordinance and succeeded in a petition drive to put the question on a ballot. Mayor Annise Parker and other defenders of the law say a repeal would damage the reputation of the city, which hosts the 2017 Super Bowl.

10/23/15,18,Front,Perverse campaign against gay rights ,"THE BATTLE OVER Houston's nondiscrimination law took a real ugly turn last week when opponents aired one of the most outrageous and disgustingly deceptive ads in their effort to repeal it at the ballot box in November.
Even though the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance protects 15 different characteristics from discrimination in Texas's largest city, those who want to kill the legislation are focused on only one of them: gender identity. And they are ginning up support and misinformed hysteria by calling it ""the bathroom ordinance.""
Take a look at the ad from an outfit called the Campaign for Houston. The last frame is as terrifying as the entire ad is flat-out false.
Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt; even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, and if a business tried to stop them they'd be fined. Protect women's privacy. Prevent danger. Vote ""no"" on the Proposition 1 ""bathroom ordinance."" It goes too far.
What goes too far is this bigoted ad and its perversion of the facts. It is an outright lie to say ""any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom at any time simply by claiming to be a woman that day.""
Such a statement reveals a willful ignorance of what it means to be transgender. In addition, the so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" people completely ignore a rather specific Houston law that has been on the books since 1972.
According to Code 1968, ¬ß 28-42.6; Ord. No. 72-904, ¬ß 2, 6-2-72 , ""It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly and intentionally enter any public restroom designated for the exclusive use of the sex opposite to such person's sex without the permission of the owner, tenant, manager, lessee or other person in charge of the premises, in a manner calculated to cause a disturbance."" In short, if you're in the bathroom for any purpose other than relieving yourself, you're breaking the law. And if you're in there to molest children or commit rape, you're also a monster.
Due to a legal challenge to HERO, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the Houston city council to repeal the law or put it up for popular vote this November. The straightforward question asks whether the law should go into effect.
""Are you in favor of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, Ord. No. 2014-530, which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy?""
HERO foes ignore the fact that nine other Texas cities with more than 100,000 already have anti-discrimination laws on the books. According to Texas Monthly, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin have had them ""for at least a decade."" Space City isn't breaking new ground here.
That there is such a pitched battle over the Houston statute is further proof that the fight for equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans did not end with the Supreme Court's marriage-equality ruling in June. And it makes clear that opponents will stop at nothing to ensure that full equality never comes.
Last week, Samantha Power received an award from the Council for Global Equality. The group, which pushes to have American foreign policy inclusive of sexual orientation and gender identity, presented the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations with its Global Equality Leadership Award. While Power's remarks had nothing to do with Houston, the sentiment they expressed definitely applied. ""If we are horrified by Power then added this: ""We are all striving to create respect for LGBT rights in those countries because we are not willing to accept a world where basic human rights can only be enjoyed in constricted places. Whether that place is a home or a neighborhood or a state or a country. There can't be no-go zones for these rights to be real.""
If the voters of Houston reject Proposition 1, they will create a no-go zone for LGBT people. And they better be prepared for the backlash that will result.

10/22/15,18,B,LETTERS - Equal rights ,"Ignoring facts
Regarding ""Patrick takes to the airwaves to oppose HERO"" (Page B1, Tuesday), Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is once again pretending to be the protector of women with his opposition to the HERO non-discrimination ordinance.
First he claimed that his sonogram bill showed his concern for women's welfare, rather than his determination to impose the will of affluent right-wing males upon pregnant women who cannot afford to travel out of state to end pregnancies that will result in children whom they cannot afford to raise.
Now he's trying to convince us that transgender women are far likelier than heterosexual men to enter a women's restroom with predatory intent, thus showing an incredible ignorance of population and crime statistics and of gender-identity issues.
I would entrust my welfare to the few transgender women I've known far more than I would to men like Dan Patrick - men who do not wish to be confused by facts.
Page S. Williams, Houston Older, wiser
Regarding ""Getting out the early vote"" (Page A1, Monday), Houstonians must vote to protect older people and others in this community by supporting Proposition 1, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
Approval of HERO would help ensure that Houston provides its residents and visitors with an environment free of discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity or pregnancy.
Older workers, grandparents, unpaid family caregivers and others age 50 and older bring vitality to Houston.
With nearly 700,000 households in Harris County headed by someone age 50 or older, Houston should build upon, and do nothing to damage, its growing reputation as a livable community.
Bob Jackson, AARP Texas director Federal laws
Proposition 1 is not about bathrooms. It is a vehicle which would establish a city bureaucracy enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws.
The cash-strapped city government needs to focus on its primary enforcement mission, rather than duplicating the mission of federal authorities.
David Haim, HoustonCarrying on campus
Regarding ""Some professors lead fight against campus carry"" (Page A1, Sunday), in the midst of the hysteria that is being spurred by the campus carry law that doesn't even go into effect until next August, I have to laugh at all the disdain and hand-wringing that the anti-gun people are expressing.
The concealed carry law has been in effect in Texas since 1995. Everyday most people are standing in line or walking down the street or passing someone in the store aisle who is carrying a gun, and they probably don't know it. Nothing seems to be happening to them now.
The campus carry law explicitly says only licensed CHL holders would be legally allowed to carry; no different than what has been going on across the state for 20 years.
Mark Stavrakis, Friendswood Proposition 6
Regarding ""Texas propositions"" (Page B8, Oct. 14), Ducks Unlimited and Coastal Conservation Association with a coalition of 60 other major Texas hunting, fishing and conservation groups represent Texas' 2.7 million hunters and anglers who strongly support Proposition 6 - the right to hunt and fish constitutional amendment.
The rights of average citizens to continue hunting and fishing using traditional methods have come under increasing fire by outside forces.
Prop 6 is necessary to create a barrier against efforts by well-funded national extremist groups trying to erode our sporting heritage and hunting and fishing activities.
Rusty Legg, state chairman
Ducks Unlimited and Robby Byers, executive director, CCA Texas Eyes on Denmark
Regarding ""Something's not so rotten in Denmark"" (Page B5, Tuesday), Paul Krugman says Denmark is an example of a welfare state that taxes heavily but enjoys high employment, prosperity. If Krugman is so enamored of socialism why not go all the way and have communism as a replacement for capitalism? It worked so well in the Soviet Union, didn't it?
Denmark has a very homogeneous populace unlike the United States, and it is also an anomaly among socialistic countries in that it is not yet bankrupt.
The sad part of this story is that the elected officials in our federal government seem to be drinking the same Kool-Aid as Krugman and keep increasing our debt limit.
Ralph Tibiletti, Spring
Planned Parenthood
Regarding ""Bad policy"" (Page B5, Tuesday), the editorial, while on-point, did not go far enough. The videotape used by our state lawmakers as a basis for defunding Planned Parenthood had previously been submitted to forensic analysis and shown to have been heavily and deceitfully edited. That analysis was then vetted by two other groups of experts who came to the same conclusion. Of further concern is the fact that our own state Health and Human Services Commission has yet to find Planned Parenthood guilty of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, our lawmakers are proceeding with the aforementioned cuts anyway. This is worse than misguided; it is also both blatantly dishonest and prejudicial.Sadly, our elected state representatives, like the previous and present governors, are clearly unable to rise above partisan politics and do what is best for hundreds of thousands of fellow Texans.
Marty Adams, Houston Canadian politics
Regarding ""Obama Keystone veto would help Trudeau reset alliance with U.S."" (HoustonChronicle.com, Tuesday), ""No"" to Keystone is good for Canada and good for the U.S. Alternatives to tar sands are available, and we need to choose them.
All pipelines eventually leak, and Keystone would move tar sands over 1,100 waterways, including endangered waterways.

10/21/15,18,B,"HERO bashing - Opponents' ""bathroom"" argument about the equal right ordinance perverts the truth. ","Dan Patrick has been around Houston long enough for Houstonians to consider him a local figure, and he is, of course, but he's also the lieutenant governor of Texas. As a statewide elected official he's well aware that nine other Texas cities with populations of 100,000 or more provide their residents with the protections afforded by an equal rights ordinance similar to Houston's. He's also aware that not one of those cities - we repeat, not one - has experienced any problems with transgender women lurking in bathrooms waiting to attack little boys or girls. Nevertheless, Patrick is taking to the air waves this week to tell voters that ""no woman should have to share a public restroom or locker room with a man.""
The lieutenant governor knows that the bathroom argument perverts the truth, which makes his ad campaign nothing more than cheap and cynical political opportunism. He has a few fences to mend with the tea party crowd that put him in office - they feel he wasn't as obstinate and unyielding in Austin as he promised to be - and HERO opposition is a convenient opportunity for him to refresh his tea-party bona fides.
""The lieutenant governor must know it's illegal now - and will always be - to enter the wrong restroom,"" Richard Carlborn, spokesman for supporters of the ordinance, told the Chronicle. ""The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance doesn't change that. What's shocking is that funders of those opposed to the equal rights ordinance want to roll back protections - in 2015 - of African- Americans, veterans, women and many other Houstonians.""
Patrick knows HERO does nothing to change the law, and Texans owner Bob McNair, City Councilmember Michael Kubosh, Harris County Commissioner Jack Cagle and other public figures who lend credence to the ridiculous bathroom claim ought to know it, as well.
What opponents should be concerned about - in addition to the city's reputation for openness and fair treatment if the ordinance is overturned - is making common cause with individuals whose primary aim is to undermine growing social acceptance for Houstonians who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. That position was most baldly expressed a couple of months ago by one of the more outspoken HERO opponents, longtime conservative activist, Dr. Stephen Hotze.
""Drive them out of our city,"" Hotze told a gathering of HERO opponents sponsored by former Harris County GOP Chairman Jared Woodfill, Tom Delay and others. ""I don't want them in our city. Send them back to San Francisco.""
Hotze went on to say - while waving a sword, no less - that HERO opponents should fight gays with the same ferocity that Allied soldiers fought Nazis, ignoring the fact that Nazis slaughtered gays, as well. His audience applauded.
That's not Houston, and neither are the absurd and deceptive anti-HERO ads running these days, including Patrick's. On Nov. 3, the real Houston, the open, accommodating, tolerant Houston, needs to stand up and let the nation know who we are. A YES vote on Proposition 1 sends that clear message.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,497,76.47,59.21,12.84,31.28,23.67,25.15,80.89,60.56,46.88,10.06,5.43,0.2,0.8,0,2.62,1.01,4.63,15.49,7.04,1.21,13.28,7.04,2.21,5.84,2.21,13.48,8.05,5.03,6.44,1.41,0.6,4.43,12.88,1.21,11.47,2.01,1.01,1.61,1.21,1.61,4.83,0,5.63,3.02,2.21,1.01,0.2,0.4,0,0.4,0,0,16.7,6.84,0.2,0,1.81,2.01,1.61,9.66,0,0,1.01,3.22,2.41,2.21,0.2,0,2.01,0.2,0.4,1.01,0.4,0,1.81,0,0,0,0,0,1.01,0.2,0.2,0.8,0.4,0.6,0,0.2,0,0.4,0.6,0,3.42,7.44,0.6,1.61,4.63,0.2,0.2,0.2,2.82,1.81,6.04,0.6,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,18.31,4.43,6.44,0,0,2.41,5.03,0,0.6,0,0,0,0,3.3,3.5,3.15,3.32,2.65,-2.27,-0.31,-0.14,-0.68,-1.65,0.4,0.2,0.2,0.4,1.61,0,0.4,0,0.6,0.2,0,0.2,0.8,0,0.4,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.67,2.02,16.43,181.09,1.61,422.54,0.6,140.85,0.6,201.21,2.01,80.48,0.4,160.97,-0.2,362.17,0,120.72,-0.4,20.12,0.2,0,0,80.48,120.72,20.12,0,60.36,181.09,0.2,140.85,120.72,20.12,40.24,20.12,0.2,0,40.24,20.12,160.97,120.72,40.24,0,1.01,1,0,1.01,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,0,0.2,0.4,0,1
10/21/15,18,Politics,Houston 'bathroom bill': Transgender rights movement seeks red-state ballot win ,"Houston has emerged as ground zero for national gay rights groups seeking a key victory on red state soil as they mobilize behind a sweeping equal rights ballot measure expanding transgender access to public restrooms.
The Human Rights Campaign, Gill Action and the American Unity Fund are among those pumping hundreds of thousands of dollars into the race over Proposition 1, which would position Houston as a national leader on transgender rights by making it illegal to deny entry to public restrooms based on gender identity.
In fact, the HRC describes itself as a founding partner, along with the ACLU of Texas and state gay rights groups, of the campaign in favor of Proposition 1, Houston Unites.
""Make a plan to cast your YES vote in support of Houston's Proposition 1 ‚Äî the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance,"" the HRC urged on Facebook as early voting began Monday.
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for the Campaign for Houston, which opposes the measure, said a win in Houston allowing opposite-sex restroom use would build momentum for similar measures in other conservative states.
""What they're trying to do is if they can win here, they want to take this ordinance to every county and city not just in the state of Texas, but across the country,"" Mr. Woodfill said.
He cited the HRC's year-old Project One America, which seeks to expand gay and transgender rights in traditionally conservative Southern states, including Texas.
""The Human Rights Campaign has committed a half-billion dollars as part of their Southern strategy to get these types of ordinances passed,"" said Mr. Woodfill. ""And that's why Houston is so important to them, because they realize that the eyes of the country are watching Houston right now.""
On paper, the homegrown opposition is badly outmatched, relying heavily on state and local donors and trailing badly on the fundraising front. The latest campaign finance reports released Oct. 5 showed the Campaign for Houston raising just $275,000 compared with $1.2 million for Houston Unites.
Not that the campaign hasn't received some national support. The Faith Family Freedom Fund, an arm of Family Research Council Action, posted a video Tuesday showing money being flushed down a toilet and warning that Proposition 1 could result in fines for those ""objecting to a man using a woman's bathroom.""
While proponents have the fundraising advantage, FRC president Tony Perkins said it ""may not be enough to counter the backlash from pastors and local citizens who refuse to be steamrolled by the national forces of political correctness.""
Not just about bathrooms
Richard Carlbom, head of Houston Unites, disputes the perception that the measure centers on the transgender bathroom issue, stressing that the goal of Proposition 1 is to offer, for the first time, municipal protections based on a broad array of characteristics.
Proposition 1 would enact the hotly debated Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination based on 15 categories, including race, gender, religion, ethnicity, veteran status, sexual orientation and gender identity.
""I think there are a lot of different groups paying attention to it,"" Mr. Carlbom said Monday. ""Just today, VoteVets released a statement really calling out the funders behind the anti-equal rights ordinance [campaign], saying that if you're against the equal rights ordinance, you're against veterans.""
He said the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance offers ""historic and most significant local protections against discrimination. ... So many people are going to be relying on this local tool, and folks who want to repeal it are really putting these folks into some danger.""
Still, it's the transgender portion that has drawn the most attention. The ordinance, which was passed by the city council last year before foes placed it on the Nov. 3 ballot, includes fines of up to $5,000 for preventing someone from using public accommodations, such as business-owned bathrooms open to the public, based on gender identity.
Seventeen states and about 200 localities have banned discrimination based on gender identity, according to the ACLU, but many of those laws and ordinances stick to less controversial protections, such as prohibiting discrimination in hiring and housing.
Some of those that prohibit discrimination in public accommodations specifically exclude public restrooms ‚Äî such as Fort Worth and Plano, Texas ‚Äî or limit their ordinances to government buildings.
Other cities, including Austin, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., as well as universities and businesses, have attempted to compromise by requiring businesses to convert single-stall public restrooms from gender-specific to gender-neutral.
The ACLU describes the move toward gender-neutral, single-stall restrooms as ""useful"" but not ideal, saying the organization ""believes that transgender people should have the right to use restrooms that match their gender identity rather than being restricted to only using gender-neutral ones.""
Ad battle on public safety
Opponents of Proposition 1 have scored with highly charged ads raising the specter of male sexual predators trolling women's rooms. The latest campaign television spot doesn't pull any punches, showing a man trapping a little girl in a restroom stall.
""Any man at any time could enter a women's bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day,"" says the ad. ""No one is exempt. Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, and if a business tried to stop them, they'd be fined.""
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick paid for his own television ad urging a no vote, in which he says, ""City of Houston Prop 1 is not about equality. That's already the law. It's about allowing men in women's locker rooms and bathrooms.""
Foes have blasted such arguments as ""scare tactics."" In a fundraising email, Mr. Carlbom described the Patrick ad as ""his latest underhanded attempt to paint Proposition 1 as dangerous and to frighten Houstonians into voting NO now that early voting has begun.""
In an ad in favor of Proposition 1, city Councilman Ed Gonzalez, a retired police officer, notes that, ""It's already illegal for men to go into a women's bathroom to harm and harass someone. Proposition 1 won't change that.""
In response, the Alliance Defending Freedom's Erik Stanley argues in a legal analysis that the Houston ordinance makes it impossible to prevent such crimes.
""Previously, if a man was seen going into the women's restroom, store personnel would stop him and notify the police,"" said Mr. Stanley in the Oct. 12 document. ""But the Proposed Ordinance would remove a barrier of protection that has always existed, and make it easier for sexual predators to commit these types of crimes.""
Houston Unites has also responded with ads diverting attention from the transgender debate, such as one showing an Air Force vet, Noel Freeman, describing how he faced discrimination in hiring over his veteran status.
While federal law prohibits such discrimination, ""there was no local protection,"" Mr. Freeman says. ""My only choice was to make a federal case out of it. I was unemployed. Where am I going to find the money to hire a lawyer?""
The Yes on Prop 1 campaign may also benefit from ballot confusion: A Republican-backed state measure that would raise the homestead tax exemption is also named Proposition 1.
Locally, Houston Unites touts support from the Greater Houston Black Chamber and the NAACP, although the black community is split on the measure, said Richard Murray, political science professor at the University of Houston.
""You have a sort of unusual lineup here,"" said Mr. Murray. ""You've got some white, older conservatives that are strongly 'no,' but you've also got a number of African-American ministers, whose congregations usually vote differently from the white conservatives, on the same side urging a 'no' vote.""
While Texas is conservative, Mr. Murray noted that Houston, like other big cities, is more liberal than the state as a whole. Houston voters three times elected Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city and the driving force behind the ordinance.
If voters defeat the measure, Ms. Parker and business interests warn that Houston could lose the Super Bowl in 2017. Last week, however, the No on Prop 1 camp announced it had received a donation from the owner of the NFL's Houston Texans.
""One of their big scare tactics is, 'Oh, we're going to lose the Super Bowl,'"" said Mr. Woodfill. ""Then Bob McNair, who owns the Texans, committed $10,000 to our campaign. So that argument kind of went by the wayside.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1382,91.04,50.84,13.09,12.63,22.29,26.85,80.25,55.72,43.7,6.58,2.6,0.29,0.14,0.43,0.58,0.87,3.98,14.98,8.68,2.53,14.11,5.35,3.26,5.28,1.16,11.29,5.79,3.18,6.51,0.58,1.01,5.07,10.85,0.87,9.99,0.72,2.24,1.16,1.45,0.22,3.84,0,3.47,1.37,2.1,0.72,0,0.72,0.29,0.22,0,0,12.88,6.73,0.72,0.72,1.37,0.43,2.32,6.51,0.14,0,0.87,1.81,3.69,3.26,0.22,0.22,3.98,0.51,0.29,1.95,1.3,0.29,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,0,0,0.07,0.14,0.43,0.07,0.07,0,0.36,1.3,0.29,3.76,8.03,0.72,1.16,5.21,0.87,0,0.07,2.46,2.82,3.33,0.87,0.22,0,0.14,0.07,0,20.19,5.57,7.24,0.07,0,2.24,5.07,0,0.14,0,0.29,0,0.07,3.81,4.11,3.37,3.64,3.09,-3.35,-1.87,-0.8,-1.26,-1.87,0.36,0.65,0.14,0.22,1.59,0.51,1.16,0,0.43,0.22,0.14,0.22,1.16,0.29,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0,0.07,1.58,0.98,16.9,94.07,0.58,296.67,-0.36,94.07,0.87,144.72,1.16,79.59,-0.65,274.96,0,354.56,0,94.07,0.29,36.18,0.36,7.24,0,79.59,137.48,108.54,36.18,14.47,108.54,0,144.72,137.48,57.89,28.94,0,0,0,101.3,21.71,86.83,130.25,65.12,14.47,0.8,1,0.51,1.66,0.07,0,0,0.07,0.22,0,0.51,0.22,0.51,0.07,1

Other cities, including Austin, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., as well as universities and businesses, have attempted to compromise by requiring businesses to convert single-stall public restrooms from gender-specific to gender-neutral.
The ACLU describes the move toward gender-neutral, single-stall restrooms as ""useful"" but not ideal, saying the organization ""believes that transgender people should have the right to use restrooms that match their gender identity rather than being restricted to only using gender-neutral ones.""
Ad battle on public safety
Opponents of Proposition 1 have scored with highly charged ads raising the specter of male sexual predators trolling women's rooms. The latest campaign television spot doesn't pull any punches, showing a man trapping a little girl in a restroom stall.
""Any man at any time could enter a women's bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day,"" says the ad. ""No one is exempt. Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom, and if a business tried to stop them, they'd be fined.""
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick paid for his own television ad urging a no vote, in which he says, ""City of Houston Prop 1 is not about equality. That's already the law. It's about allowing men in women's locker rooms and bathrooms.""
Foes have blasted such arguments as ""scare tactics."" In a fundraising email, Mr. Carlbom described the Patrick ad as ""his latest underhanded attempt to paint Proposition 1 as dangerous and to frighten Houstonians into voting NO now that early voting has begun.""
In an ad in favor of Proposition 1, city Councilman Ed Gonzalez, a retired police officer, notes that, ""It's already illegal for men to go into a women's bathroom to harm and harass someone. Proposition 1 won't change that.""
In response, the Alliance Defending Freedom's Erik Stanley argues in a legal analysis that the Houston ordinance makes it impossible to prevent such crimes.
""Previously, if a man was seen going into the women's restroom, store personnel would stop him and notify the police,"" said Mr. Stanley in the Oct. 12 document. ""But the Proposed Ordinance would remove a barrier of protection that has always existed, and make it easier for sexual predators to commit these types of crimes.""
Houston Unites has also responded with ads diverting attention from the transgender debate, such as one showing an Air Force vet, Noel Freeman, describing how he faced discrimination in hiring over his veteran status.
While federal law prohibits such discrimination, ""there was no local protection,"" Mr. Freeman says. ""My only choice was to make a federal case out of it. I was unemployed. Where am I going to find the money to hire a lawyer?""
The Yes on Prop 1 campaign may also benefit from ballot confusion: A Republican-backed state measure that would raise the homestead tax exemption is also named Proposition 1.
Locally, Houston Unites touts support from the Greater Houston Black Chamber and the NAACP, although the black community is split on the measure, said Richard Murray, political science professor at the University of Houston.
""You have a sort of unusual lineup here,"" said Mr. Murray. ""You've got some white, older conservatives that are strongly 'no,' but you've also got a number of African-American ministers, whose congregations usually vote differently from the white conservatives, on the same side urging a 'no' vote.""
While Texas is conservative, Mr. Murray noted that Houston, like other big cities, is more liberal than the state as a whole. Houston voters three times elected Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major city and the driving force behind the ordinance.
If voters defeat the measure, Ms. Parker and business interests warn that Houston could lose the Super Bowl in 2017. Last week, however, the No on Prop 1 camp announced it had received a donation from the owner of the NFL's Houston Texans.
""One of their big scare tactics is, 'Oh, we're going to lose the Super Bowl,'"" said Mr. Woodfill. ""Then Bob McNair, who owns the Texans, committed $10,000 to our campaign. So that argument kind of went by the wayside.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,1382,91.04,50.84,13.09,12.63,22.29,26.85,80.25,55.72,43.7,6.58,2.6,0.29,0.14,0.43,0.58,0.87,3.98,14.98,8.68,2.53,14.11,5.35,3.26,5.28,1.16,11.29,5.79,3.18,6.51,0.58,1.01,5.07,10.85,0.87,9.99,0.72,2.24,1.16,1.45,0.22,3.84,0,3.47,1.37,2.1,0.72,0,0.72,0.29,0.22,0,0,12.88,6.73,0.72,0.72,1.37,0.43,2.32,6.51,0.14,0,0.87,1.81,3.69,3.26,0.22,0.22,3.98,0.51,0.29,1.95,1.3,0.29,1.3,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,0,0,0.07,0.14,0.43,0.07,0.07,0,0.36,1.3,0.29,3.76,8.03,0.72,1.16,5.21,0.87,0,0.07,2.46,2.82,3.33,0.87,0.22,0,0.14,0.07,0,20.19,5.57,7.24,0.07,0,2.24,5.07,0,0.14,0,0.29,0,0.07,3.81,4.11,3.37,3.64,3.09,-3.35,-1.87,-0.8,-1.26,-1.87,0.36,0.65,0.14,0.22,1.59,0.51,1.16,0,0.43,0.22,0.14,0.22,1.16,0.29,0.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0,0.07,1.58,0.98,16.9,94.07,0.58,296.67,-0.36,94.07,0.87,144.72,1.16,79.59,-0.65,274.96,0,354.56,0,94.07,0.29,36.18,0.36,7.24,0,79.59,137.48,108.54,36.18,14.47,108.54,0,144.72,137.48,57.89,28.94,0,0,0,101.3,21.71,86.83,130.25,65.12,14.47,0.8,1,0.51,1.66,0.07,0,0,0.07,0.22,0,0.51,0.22,0.51,0.07,1

10/20/15,18,Opinion,HERO ordinance affects us all ,"Houston is battling it out over HERO, Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. I‚Äôm appalled at the horrific lies indicating this ordinance is about bathroom privileges.
HERO gives a local avenue for combatting discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity or pregnancy. Texas is one of about 20 states that don‚Äôt already have discrimination laws, leaving the responsibility to the cities. It is too slow and too expensive to take most cases to the federal level and the more local laws and ordinances would provide a more expedient and economical way of handling most cases.
We are all being subjected to anti-HERO radio ads spreading lies and fear-mongering, but with just a tiny bit of research the truth in how dishonest those claims are bears out. The idea that voters will somehow believe that this ordinance legalizes child predators is insulting to Houston voters.
What does this have to do with Galveston? I hope someday very soon, we consider a similar ordinance protecting the citizens, following Houston‚Äôs lead with this ordinance ‚Äî but not with the propaganda.

10/20/15,18,B,"Patrick takes to the airwaves to oppose HERO - LIeutenant governor lends voice, pocketbook to TV, radio ads, blasts Parker over ordinance ","
With the start of early voting Monday, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick began lending his voice and his pocketbook to radio and TV ads urging Houston voters to reject the city's embattled equal rights ordinance.
At a news conference Monday in Houston, Patrick echoed the chief criticism of equal rights ordinance opponents - that the law would allow men to enter women's restrooms - and he blasted Mayor Annise Parker, saying she ""ought to be embarrassed"" by the ordinance.
In Patrick's TV ad, set to begin Tuesday airing on cable and network stations, he tells voters that ""no woman should have to share a public restroom or locker room with a man.""
The radio and TV ads totaling about $70,000 were paid for by Texans for Dan Patrick. The former Republican state senator from Houston defended his decision to wade into a local issue.
""I think this is an extraordinary circumstance,"" Patrick said. ""This is absurd. Years ago, a decade ago, we would laugh at even thinking about that the people would cast a vote to keep men out of ladies rooms.""
Richard Carlbom, spokesman for supporters of the ordinance, pushed back on Patrick's ad in a statement Monday.
""The lieutenant governor must know it's illegal now - and will always be - to enter the wrong restroom,"" he said. ""The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance doesn't change that. What's shocking is that funders of those opposed to the equal rights ordinance want to roll back protections - in 2015 - of African-Americans, veterans, women, and many other Houstonians.""
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for opponents, hailed Patrick's ads as a sign of growing momentum. ""It's outstanding to see an elected official at his level standing against the ordinance,"" Woodfill said.
Last week, opponents of the law released a controversial ad that closes with a man entering a stall occupied by a young girl. Patrick's ad takes a considerably less dramatic approach, simply showing photos of bathrooms with gender designations.
The issue of bathroom access has driven much of the debate surrounding the law that City Council passed 11-6 last year. Opponents of the law claim it will allow any man who claims to be a woman access to a woman's restroom, Supporters of the law, however, point to a long-standing law that bars anyone from entering a restroom of the opposite sex with the intent to cause a disturbance.
Under the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, is banned. Opponents criticize the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting are subject to the ordinance and could face fines of up to $5,000 for violations. Religious organizations are exempt.
During the few months the equal rights ordinance was in effect - the city suspended enforcement for more than a year while litigation was pending - 11 discrimination complaints were filed. Five of the cases alleged racial discrimination, another five LGBT discrimination, and one claimed gender discrimination. Supporters of the ordinance have sought to cast the law in a broader scope in recent weeks, unveiling an ad last week that features veterans covered under the law.
Both supporters and opponents have been spending heavily as they look to flood the airwaves during early voting, which runs from Oct. 19-30 leading up to the Nov. 3 election.

10/17/15,18,B,"Ups and downs - Jolanda's big leap, the Big Jinx from Austin and raising a toast to the craft brewers. ","Thumbs up: We'd be surprised if there's a street on the planet with as much construction as Travis between Alabama and the north end of downtown. We counted 14 new developments and more than a handful of tower cranes on that two-mile stretch. The billion- dollar question, of course, is what happens in the current economy after these buildings are topped out? Until then, hug a general contractor, an architect and a developer today.
Thumbs down: The problem with driving downtown is that traffic lights remain out of sequence, creating a maddening crawl from end-to-end. Who's to blame? A lame-duck mayor? A Public Works Department forgetting about its customers? The new Metro rail line? We don't know. But we'd sure like leadership who cares.
Thumbs down: One of those mayoral candidates, the former sheriff, uses a 3-year-old Chronicle endorsement in his television ads and implies it's current.
Thumbs up: State Rep. Garnet Coleman, flanked by an A-list of elected officials, launched a petition drive to rename Dowling Street as Emancipation Avenue. Richard Dowling was a Confederate officer, and it is believed the street, which bisects an African- American neighborhood, was named after him in the late 1800s to remind local residents of their place in the racist South. We wholeheartedly wish Coleman success in his effort.
Thumbs up: If there's an election for Chief Avenger in Crush City, our unqualified endorsement goes to Jolanda Jones. The former city councilwoman and current candidate for HISD trustee spotted a thief breaking in to her car in the Third Ward midday this week. The one-time UH track great sprinted after the fleeing vehicle and leapt on it before inertia thwarted her effort to stop the crooks.
Thumbs down: Sorry, Greg, but we're blaming the Astros collapse on you. Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted a congratulatory message to the Astros on their victory Monday. The problem is somebody hit ""send"" before the deal was sealed, the ultimate jinx. Kansas City scored five runs minutes later, and the Astros' players are at the beach today. What about sticking to policy instead of sports, sir?
Thumbs down: As long as we're offering elected officials advice today, can't they do something about parking lot operators charging $50 for spots on playoff game days? It's called price gouging.
Thumbs up: If there's any doubt that confusion reigns with the Texans, don't just focus on the offense, defense and special teams. Team owner Bob McNair this week wrote a $10,000 check to opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. Meanwhile, team President Jamey Rootes, who soon becomes chair of the Greater Houston Partnership, has pointed out the perils of not passing the ordinance, which GHP supports. Opponents of HERO are leading a divisive, politically motivated attack that is the last-gasp of homophobia in town. McNair should stop payment on that check.
And finally today, we toast scrappy craft brewers like Houston-based Saint Arnold, Karbach and Buffalo Bayou Brewing. Not only do they make tasty suds, but they and their peers have the big boys, InBev and SABMiller, looking for savings from consolidation.

Regarding ""Clinton, Sanders clash in debate"" (Page A1, Wednesday), for a party that touts diversity, what was on stage was old, rich, white people.

Term limits
Regarding ""Prop. 2. Voting ""yes"" will change City Council term limits"" (Page B7, Tuesday), with the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance dominating the conversation around the Houston city elections, another very important vote has flown a bit under the radar.
Also on the ballot is the vote to change city council members' term limits from three, two-year terms to two, four-year terms. This important proposition could change the way Houston politics will look for the foreseeable future.
The term limits will affect how the city is run, how effective candidates will be at their job and how candidates campaign for their office.
With the way that the term limits are set up right now, candidates have to start campaigning almost as soon as they're elected. If voters approve Proposition 2, that will change for the better.

10/17/15,18,B,Proposition 2 could keep officials around - Term limits would be increased now if measure passes ,"Think hard about your choices for mayor, controller and City Council this fall: If the winners mess up, you might have to wait twice as long to kick them out.
Lost in the chaos of Houston's first open mayoral race in six years and the brawl over the city's nondiscrimination ordinance is what will appear on the ballot as City of Houston Proposition 2: changing Houston's 24-year-old system of term limits to let officials serve up to two four-year terms, rather than the current maximum of three two-year terms.
The change would take effect immediately, allowing some incumbents to serve longer than the six years they originally signed up for. Mayor Annise Parker had proposed delaying the effective date of the change to affect no incumbents; council overrode that proposal.
""You have the right to vote people out, and if you're not voting them out they must not be doing that bad of a job,"" said Councilman Jerry Davis, who supports the ballot item. ""It allows us to get in here and get some work done. One year in, one year back out there talking to people trying to get re-elected. It's not enough time. When you get the hang of it, then it's time to go.""
Total of 10 years
The term limits shift would let current freshman council members serve two more four-year terms, for a total of 10 years. Those serving their second terms, such as Davis, would be permitted one 4-year term, for a total of eight years. Those finishing their third terms, including Parker, are not permitted to run again.
Since voters first limited local leaders' stay in each office to three two-year terms in 1991, changes to term limits have been discussed five times, with the sixth attempt this year finally placing an item before voters.
Supporters of the measure say council members barely learn the ways to make change in government before they are flushed out, making an already strong-mayor form of government even stronger, allowing the bureaucrats in her employ to ""wait out"" council members whose proposals they dislike and empowering experienced lobbyists.
Those skeptical of the change say shorter terms allow a regular infusion of new thinking into city government by lessening the bulwark of incumbency and ensuring independence from entrenched interests. This is a particular risk, they say, since a court this year killed city rules that prevented officials from raising money year-round.
Though pundits originally had predicted the item was doomed without organized support - of which there has been none - a recent poll conducted by Rice University political scientist Bob Stein showed 44 percent of likely voters support the change, 40 percent oppose it and 15 percent are unsure.
Support falls
When told the measure would allow some incumbents to stay in office longer, however, voter support fell to 31 percent and opposition rose to 48 percent
""When you're told this is essentially a benefit for the people who are in office, you reverse your position,"" Stein said. ""The people who are voting still don't know it's being implemented in 2016."" Supporters included progressives who typically oppose term limits, Stein said, and black voters who like their current representatives. About 60 percent of those who said the city is doing an ""excellent"" or ""good"" job support the change, he said, a figure that fell sharply among those who grade the city's performance as ""fair"" or ""poor."" Conservatives, who generally distrust government, he said, also were opposed.
Councilman C.O. Bradford, who opposed placing the item on the ballot, said the city charter needs far more sweeping revisions to ensure, among other things, that council members have more input and that the budget process is more effective. Only touching term limits, he said, won't help.
""The local governance process is broken and until you fix the process, why leave people at City Hall for a longer term without accountability? It's not a good policy,"" Bradford said. ""It exacerbates the difficulty that exists at City Hall today.""
Parker said longer terms are a ""good government"" reform she has long supported, but the mayor said it was a ""terrible mistake"" to make them take effect immediately. Parker said she would still be willing to campaign for the current ballot item, but is instead focusing her attention - as are many voters - on protecting the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, city Proposition 1, from repeal.
Backing from council
Davis and Councilman Larry Green say they both are campaigning for the term limits change in their districts.
Both also pushed back on the idea that wording of the proposition was an example of self-serving incumbents wanting to stay in office longer.
""I'm very happy to serve my six years and be done, but I do think it is in the best interest of the city to have two 4-year terms because I just think you get better government,"" Green said. ""Whenever it's implemented, somebody is going to benefit, whether now or down the road. I think you should just focus on the actual concept as opposed to who's benefitting and who's not.

10/16/15,18,A,HERO debate goes off-topic - Claims about restroom access dominate talk ,"McNair donates to HERO opponents: Page B1
Although Houston's 36-page equal rights ordinance makes no mention of public restrooms, access to restrooms has become the focus of a raging public debate with the law set to go before voters on Election Day.
Opponents of the ordinance, largely conservative Christians, have flooded radio and TV with ads saying the law gives men dressed in women's clothing, including sexual predators, the ability to enter a women's restroom. On Tuesday, the group released a TV spot that closes with a man bursting into a stall occupied by a young girl.
Supporters of the law, however, said the ordinance would in no way protect predators, pointing to a longstanding city law that bars someone from entering a restroom of the opposite sex with the intent to ""cause a disturbance."" Legal experts agree the equal rights ordinance does not offer any protections to those who commit crimes, such as the oft-cited example of sexual assault, in a bathroom or any other place.
University of Houston law professor Peter Linzer said the law does not mean someone can enter a bathroom with the intent to commit a crime, regardless of gender.
""It's a phony issue,"" Linzer said. ""If you commit a crime in a bathroom, you're going to be prosecuted, and HERO is not a defense.""
Under the Houston equal rights ordinance, or HERO, discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, is banned. Opponents criticize the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting are subject to the ordinance and could face fines of up to $5,000 for violations. Religious organizations are exempt.
'Misleading' argument
City Council passed the ordinance last year. During the few months it was in effect - the Parker administration suspended enforcement while opponents sued the city for more than a year - 11 discrimination complaints were filed. Five of the cases alleged racial discrimination, another five LGBT discrimination and one claimed gender discrimination. A settlement was reached in one of the five LGBT cases, and the gender case was closed due to insufficient evidence. The rest are pending investigation while the law is on hold awaiting November's election.
""It's a little misleading to focus on bathrooms,"" said Matthew Festa, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law. ""What the law really does is broaden the protected classes, but all you hear about is the bathrooms.""
The ordinance does not specifically entertain bathroom access; draft language that addressed the restroom issue head-on was thrown out amid political pushback last spring.
The abandoned provision said it was illegal to ""deny any person entry to any restroom, shower room, or similar facility if that facility is consistent with and appropriate to that person's expression of gender identity."" It went on, however, to offer business owners a defense if they denied someone access to such a facility with the ""good faith belief that the gender or gender identity of the person discriminated against was not consistent with the gender designation of the facility.""
But the final version of the law offers no mention of restrooms, referring more broadly to public accommodations.
Former city attorney David Feldman, who drafted the rights law, said business owners still retain the right to deny a person they believe to be a man access to a women's restroom, or vice versa. Where the equal rights ordinance applies is in how the business owner or manager phrases such an objection, Feldman said.
If the owners were to tell a patron they genuinely believed the person to be a man attempting to enter a women's restroom, Feldman said it would be difficult to prove discrimination. But a slur or attack on someone's gender identity, for instance, would put the business owner in violation of the law.
""The problem as I see it is that the debate itself is an irrational one,"" Feldman said. ""It's based on a false premise, the false premise is that any guy has a right to go into a ladies' restroom.""
Concern for employers
Joe Gagnon, a labor attorney with Fisher & Phillips LLP, said he views the bathroom protections as an ""open issue."" Gagnon said that under the current ordinance, business owners, managers and employers are best to err on the side of caution. It's not clear under what circumstance an employer or business owner could legally deny someone access to a restroom, Gagnon said.
""It's complicated,"" Gagnon said. ""And the concern I have for employers is that they have little clarity on what constitutes discrimination.""
Recently, opponents drafted a memo of examples they say prove men have used access to women's restrooms for criminal purposes. The examples largely include men donning women's clothing to videotape women in rest-rooms, an illegal act. In the only instance of sexual assault documented in the memo, a man falsely claiming to be transgender gained access to two women's shelters in Toronto in 2013 where he sexually assaulted two women. The man was convicted and given a life sentence, according to the Toronto Sun.
Campaign spokesman Jared Woodfill said he is concerned the same could happen in Houston.
""Under the law, as a female in a restroom, a male who believes he is a female can walk in there and shower with you,"" Woodfill said. ""If it's a locker room, they can change clothes with you while they are there. They can make you uncomfortable and violate your sense of privacy.""
Mayor Annise Parker pushed back this week on the idea that the ordinance in any way presents a public safety threat. The law is intended to protect someone's consistent gender identity, not someone seeking to illegally gain access to a restroom.
""Two-hundred cities, 17 states have the same ordinance that we do or very similar wording that we do,"" Parker said. ""This just doesn't happen. It is illegal for a sexual predator to go into a women's restroom and attack anyone, and the idea that somehow the city of Houston is giving them free license is so offensive.""
Supporters of the ordinance have also questioned the authority of opponents on the issue of sexual conduct, given allegations against one of the group's leaders.
Controversial opponent
The Rev. Kendall Baker, a vocal member of Campaign for Houston and candidate for City Council District F, was indefinitely suspended from his position as a 311 supervisor with the city after an investigator substantiated sexual harassment claims lodged against him. The Office of Inspector General report issued in 2013 found that Baker had ""solicited sexual acts, made crude comments about female anatomy and engaged in inappropriate physical contact by hugging subordinate female employees.""
Baker said the findings of the OIG report were inaccurate and retaliatory. ""That was an act of discrimination,"" Baker said. ""It was a wrongful termination.""
During an exchange at City Council with Baker last year where he questioned whether the Office of Inspector General was up to the task of investigating complaints made under the equal rights ordinance, Parker made reference to Baker's own history with the OIG.
""You are proof we do a good job in the OIG, sir,"" she said.
Baker is featured heavily in the opponents' campaign ads, including a radio spot where he calls the ordinance ""shameful.""
""We have a moral obligation to protect women from the potential danger of perverted men,"" Baker says in the ad.
A recent KHOU/KUHF poll showed that, among supporters of the law, only 15 percent said they could not support the ordinance given the knowledge than a man who identifies and dresses as a woman could use a women's restroom.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1294,95.14,71.73,17.2,8.64,21.93,26.82,80.99,56.72,45.44,6.49,2.86,0.15,0.31,0.62,0.7,0.77,3.63,15.84,11.98,1.39,13.52,6.18,2.01,4.56,0.93,12.44,4.71,2.16,7.34,0.77,0.39,6.26,11.36,0.54,10.74,1.85,1.55,0.93,3.09,0.31,3.94,0,3.17,0.93,2.16,0.7,0.23,0.39,0,0.23,0,0,16.62,6.8,0.31,0.15,1.62,0.85,2.78,9.58,0.08,0,1.55,1.7,1.62,1.24,0.23,0.15,5.1,0.31,0.46,3.79,0.77,0.31,2.16,0.08,0,0,0,0,1.16,0.62,0,0,0,0.15,0.08,0,0,0.15,0.93,0,2.63,6.88,0.31,1.16,5.18,0.31,0.08,0.15,2.24,4.4,3.71,0.23,0.08,0,0.08,0,0,17.47,4.56,6.41,0,0,2.16,4.33,0,0.15,0,0.46,0,0.08,4.18,4.57,3.54,3.86,3.74,-4.4,-3.07,-1.83,-2.21,-2.67,0.08,0.54,0.15,0.54,2.16,0.85,0.23,0,0.7,0.23,0.31,0.7,2.32,0.23,0.39,0,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,1.74,1.66,18.55,69.55,0.23,479.13,-1.85,216.38,1.62,123.65,0.85,77.28,-0.62,216.38,-0.46,564.14,0,77.28,0.08,38.64,0.39,15.46,0,38.64,100.46,46.37,46.37,30.91,46.37,-0.08,85.01,185.47,7.73,46.37,0,0,0,85.01,139.1,123.65,131.38,23.18,7.73,1.93,1,0.62,0.39,0,0.08,0.15,0.08,0.62,0,0.62,0.08,0.15,0.08,1
10/16/15,18,B,"McNair gives to HERO critics - Texans owner calls law divisive, urges rewrite ","Houston Texans owner Bob McNair has donated $10,000 to opponents of the city's embattled equal rights ordinance, entering the political fray over the law headed to voters this fall.
McNair, a billionaire and frequent GOP donor, mailed the $10,000 check to opponents earlier this week.
Though the donation is relatively small compared to heftier checks cut by some state and local Republican leaders - the group spent half a million in the first seven weeks - opponents heralded McNair's contribution as a significant statement.
""The HERO supporters have tried to scare people into believing that we would lose the Super Bowl,"" said Campaign for Houston spokesman Jared Woodfill. ""Obviously, if there were any truth behind that, Bob McNair wouldn't be donating to the folks that are opposed to the ordinance.""
Critics of the law, largely Christian conservatives, object to the nondiscrimination protections it extends to gay and transgender residents and allege it would allow men into women's restrooms. The ordinance also bans discrimination based on sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
The ordinance applies to businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. Religious institutions are exempt. Violators can be fined up to $5,000.
Supporters of the ordinance, including Mayor Annise Parker, have warned that repealing the law could damage the city's economy and could jeopardize high-profile events such as Houston's 2017 Super Bowl.
McNair, in a statement released Thursday, noted Houston's diversity and said he believes it is a city that ""works to ensure that everyone is treated respectfully and fairly,"" but raised objections to the ordinance.
""I strongly believe that everyone who lives or works in or visits Houston should be treated with the utmost dignity and respect,"" McNair said. ""Because of the way the HERO ordinance is written, it has begun to separate rather than unite our community. This problem can be solved by defeating the current bill in November, thoughtfully rewriting it and then resubmitting it to the voters.""
City Council member Ellen Cohen, a prominent supporter of the law, said that given McNair's history of giving to conservative causes and candidates, this donation came as ""no surprise.""
""He's one man who happens to own a sports team but the organizations involved in attracting business and conventions support the ordinance,"" Cohen said. ""The Houston convention center and visitors bureau, GHP, the Houston sports authority - just to name a few - have come out in favor of the equal rights ordinance.""
Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for supporters of the law, released a statement saying the ""vast majority of Houston business interests taking a position on Proposition 1 support it.""
""They know discrimination is bad for business and bad for the city's image,"" Carlbom said. ""Over time, companies, including sporting franchises, will stop wanting to come here.""
Supporters of the law often point to Indiana, where a so-called ""religious freedom law"" drew national scrutiny last spring. Opponents of the law there said it was discriminatory, and companies and conventions canceled planned events in the state. The NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, publicly opposed the original versions of the law as the city was preparing to host the Final Four. Amid growing political pressure, Indiana's Legislature eventually passed an amended version of the bill intended to ease concerns about discrimination against gays and lesbians.
In a recent KHOU/KUHF poll of likely voters, the economic case that supporters have posited, saying businesses and major events would not come to a city without the law's protections against discrimination, proved persuasive for some.
Among opponents of the law, 24 percent said they would change their mind if told that the National Football League would not come to Houston for the 2017 Super Bowl and the National Collegiate Athletic Association would take the Final Four elsewhere if the law was repealed.
Another 64 percent said they would not change their opposition, and 11 percent were unsure.",Campaign for Houston ,1,660,90.72,55.42,23.24,28.32,23.57,31.36,81.52,56.52,43.18,5.76,1.82,0.15,0.3,0,0.3,0.76,3.94,14.7,9.85,2.42,12.27,5.61,3.03,6.06,0.76,12.42,5.15,3.48,9.24,2.58,0.91,5.76,11.06,0.45,10.61,1.36,1.36,2.12,1.97,0.45,3.79,0,3.48,1.97,1.36,0.61,0,0.45,0.15,0,0,0,13.79,6.82,1.82,0.15,1.36,0.45,2.58,6.97,0.3,0,0.3,0.91,2.42,2.12,0.3,0,6.52,1.67,0.3,2.88,1.82,0.61,1.06,0.15,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,0,0,0.15,0.3,0,0,0,0,0.76,0.15,3.03,8.33,0.91,1.52,6.52,0.3,0,0,3.18,4.55,2.73,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,19.39,4.24,8.18,0,0,1.82,5.15,0,0.3,0.15,0,0.15,0,3.71,4.17,3.63,4.12,3.11,-2.4,-0.77,0.59,-0.28,-1.27,0.3,1.21,0,0.15,2.27,0.61,1.06,0,0.91,0,0.76,0,2.73,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.15,1.58,0.97,18.21,136.36,0.76,333.33,-0.15,106.06,1.06,106.06,0.76,136.36,-1.06,257.58,0.61,515.15,0,121.21,0.3,60.61,0.61,15.15,0,15.15,181.82,75.76,15.15,45.45,90.91,0.15,151.52,45.45,15.15,45.45,0,0,0,136.36,181.82,136.36,45.45,30.3,0,0.76,1,0.61,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0.15,0.15,0,1
10/16/15,18,A,HERO debate goes off-topic - Claims about restroom access dominate talk ,"McNair donates to HERO opponents: Page B1
Although Houston's 36-page equal rights ordinance makes no mention of public restrooms, access to restrooms has become the focus of a raging public debate with the law set to go before voters on Election Day.
Opponents of the ordinance, largely conservative Christians, have flooded radio and TV with ads saying the law gives men dressed in women's clothing, including sexual predators, the ability to enter a women's restroom. On Tuesday, the group released a TV spot that closes with a man bursting into a stall occupied by a young girl.
Supporters of the law, however, said the ordinance would in no way protect predators, pointing to a longstanding city law that bars someone from entering a restroom of the opposite sex with the intent to ""cause a disturbance."" Legal experts agree the equal rights ordinance does not offer any protections to those who commit crimes, such as the oft-cited example of sexual assault, in a bathroom or any other place.
University of Houston law professor Peter Linzer said the law does not mean someone can enter a bathroom with the intent to commit a crime, regardless of gender.
""It's a phony issue,"" Linzer said. ""If you commit a crime in a bathroom, you're going to be prosecuted, and HERO is not a defense.""
Under the Houston equal rights ordinance, or HERO, discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status, is banned. Opponents criticize the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting are subject to the ordinance and could face fines of up to $5,000 for violations. Religious organizations are exempt.
'Misleading' argument
City Council passed the ordinance last year. During the few months it was in effect - the Parker administration suspended enforcement while opponents sued the city for more than a year - 11 discrimination complaints were filed. Five of the cases alleged racial discrimination, another five LGBT discrimination and one claimed gender discrimination. A settlement was reached in one of the five LGBT cases, and the gender case was closed due to insufficient evidence. The rest are pending investigation while the law is on hold awaiting November's election.
""It's a little misleading to focus on bathrooms,"" said Matthew Festa, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law. ""What the law really does is broaden the protected classes, but all you hear about is the bathrooms.""

10/13/15,18,B,"Poll: Equal rights law supporters edge past foes - Ordinance's opponents say issue turns on small number of votes, but those in favor claim growing momentum ","
With both campaigns ramping up spending before Election Day, supporters of Houston's contentious equal rights ordinance are leading opponents by 6 percentage points, a new poll shows.
Overall, 43 percent of respondents to the KHOU/KUHF poll released Sunday supported the ordinance, 37 percent opposed it, and 18 percent were unsure of their stance. The poll offers some empirical heft to the prediction in many political circles that the fate of the ordinance will turn on a relatively small number of votes.
Broken out by race, black residents were the most evenly divided on the issue, with 40 percent in support, 39 percent opposed and 20 percent undecided.
Rice University political scientist Bob Stein, who helped run the poll, said black voters may be the most suggestible on the issue leading up to Election Day.
""The largest proportion of undecided voters are African-American,"" Stein said. ""Otherwise, generally, we tended to see that people had staked out their positions on this issue and felt very strongly one way or the other.""
Proponents of the law heralded the poll as a sign the ordinance is picking up broad support. The campaign Houston Unites reported about $1.3 million in donations during the most recent fundraising period, more than doubling critics' haul.
""Yet another poll shows the momentum is on the side of the treating everyone fairly and equally under the law,"" campaign manager Richard Carlbom said in a written statement.
Opponents, however, viewed the poll as evidence that the race will be close and that there's opportunity to sway the bloc of undecided voters.
""We're going to be very aggressive and expose this ordinance for what it really is,"" said Jared Woodfill, the group's campaign spokesman. ""What this race will really prove is who has the better turnout model.""
Political scientists have said they expect the embattled law's presence on the ballot to drive up the usually low voter turnout in November, potentially a factor in the open mayor's race.
In the last open-seat mayor's race, about 19 percent of registered voters cast a ballot. But precisely how much the law will skew turnout is hard to predict, Stein said.
The ordinance has been contentious since City Council passed it in May 2014.
The law offers legal remedies against local discrimination to 15 protected classes: sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
Opponents criticize the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents, alleging it would allow men dressed in women's clothing, including sexual predators, to enter women's restrooms. Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting are subject to the ordinance and could face fines of up to $5,000 for violations. Religious organizations are exempt.
In the poll, among those who said they support the ordinance, 72 percent said they would not change their support if they knew a man who identifies and dresses as a woman could use a woman's restroom under the law.
Another 15 percent said they could not support the ordinance given that knowledge and 12 percent said they were unsure.
Even more effective in moving voters, however, was the economic case that supporters have posited, saying businesses and major events would not come to a city without the law's legal protections against discrimination.
Among opponents of the law, 24 percent said they would change their mind if told that the National Football League would not come to Houston for the 2017 Super Bowl and the National Collegiate Athletic Association would take the Final Four elsewhere if the law was repealed.
Another 64 percent said they would not change their opposition and 11 percent were unsure.
""The rhetoric on the economic argument is quite salient,"" Stein said.
""Particularly among African-American women, that issue really moves voters.""
About 59 percent of those surveyed identified as white, 22 as black, 12 as Hispanic and 4 as Asian. Democrats made up about 42 percent, Republicans 23 percent and independents 23 percent. Twelve percent declined to answer.
The margin of error in the weighted poll was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points and included 567 registered Houston voters who said they were either certain or very likely to vote in November.",Houston Unites,1,713,88.53,46.7,26.9,27.67,22.28,28.33,83.59,60.59,44.46,6.31,2.95,0,0.28,0,0,1.96,3.37,14.59,9.12,4.63,13.18,6.17,3.79,6.03,0.7,12.62,7.29,7.01,6.17,1.12,0.7,4.63,11.5,0.14,11.22,1.4,1.26,1.54,2.95,0.7,4.21,0,3.37,1.96,1.4,0.28,0,0.28,0,0.28,0,0,12.34,6.31,1.12,0,1.4,0,2.95,5.75,0.14,0,0.7,0.42,3.65,2.95,0.7,0,4.21,0.56,0.42,2.24,0.98,0.28,1.26,0.28,0,0.14,0,0,0.7,0.14,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0,0.14,0.42,0.28,2.95,8.56,0.14,1.68,5.89,0.84,0,0.28,3.09,4.91,1.96,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,16.69,4.77,7.29,0,0,1.68,2.95,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,3.38,3.6,3.2,3.44,2.77,-1.58,-0.62,-0.15,-1.87,-1.79,0.56,1.26,0.14,0,1.4,0.28,0.42,0,0.28,0,0.28,0.28,1.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.79,1.27,17.28,140.25,0.98,210.38,0.7,140.25,0.7,238.43,0.98,126.23,-0.7,238.43,-0.14,462.83,0,126.23,-0.42,42.08,0.42,0,0,42.08,112.2,28.05,70.13,112.2,84.15,0.42,112.2,112.2,140.25,28.05,14.03,0.14,0,84.15,126.23,70.13,56.1,42.08,14.03,0.56,1,0.28,0.42,0,0,0,0.14,0.28,0,0.28,0.14,0.14,0,1

10/11/15,18,B,"Turner for mayor - Standing out in a crowded field, the veteran legislator has the skills to lead City Hall. ","Houston is unique.
No, that's not our half-baked proposal for the city's next tourism campaign. It is a statement of fact about City Hall. Among the 10 largest cities in Texas, Houston is the only one that has a mayor-council form of government. Other cities rely on an appointed manager to designate department heads, write the budget and run the day-to-day operations of the city. Houston vests all that power in the mayor. So when you hear mayoral candidates say that they're running to be Houston's CEO, that's not campaign puffery.
It is a high-risk, high-reward gambit to place this much power in a single position. The role of mayor demands a candidate who understands the dynamics of municipal policy, can navigate the political jetties of the most diverse city in the nation and also has the managerial skills to run a 10,000-person operation and $5 billion annual budget. Those talents don't always overlap. None of the seven major candidates running for mayor can claim a complete resume.
Perhaps there will be some grand moment of revelation before early voting begins, but so far each candidate seems to share the same muted vision of Houston's future. The political debate begins and ends with potholes, pensions and public safety. Those are important issues, but they can't even begin to encapsulate the historic diversity and potential of a city like Houston. Voters deserve to hear competing symphonies and they're getting only focus-tested jingles.
Because there is no perfect candidate on the ballot, voters should look for someone who has the talents best suited to fixing the problems that currently threaten Houston's long-term success: Sylvester Turner.
For the past six years, Houston has been well led by Annise Parker's competent hand. But being right on the issues only gets you part way there. Politics isn't just about policy - it is about people. Turner, more than any other candidate, grasps this reality.
How can you defend a long-term Rebuild Houston plan if Houstonians still are hitting potholes? What's the point of a pension solution if you can't get it passed in Austin? How can people feel safe when police don't respond to routine property crimes?
As Turner told the editorial board, ""people want to see improvements now.""
The technically correct answer of a well-informed policy wonk is little solace if you're dealing with a busted tire or burgled car. Houstonians need to know that their city is working for them today.
Turner, 61, was born and raised in Acres Homes in northwest Houston, the very community that he's represented in Austin for more than a quarter century. During his time in the Legislature he's proven himself a capable member of the loyal liberal opposition who can deftly wield the political process to his own benefit - and to that of his constituents, he'll remind you. But Turner is more of a team-builder than a partisan warrior, with an oft-praised ability to get people on board and remind his colleagues of their moral duty in government.
Now on his third run at the mayor's office, Turner speaks with the insight of a veteran politician. Sometimes this means an overreliance on agreeable platitudes, but it also leads him to balance long-term goals with political immediacy.
From police to potholes and economic prosperity, he has released impressively thorough issue papers that keep an eye on the horizon without losing sight of the problems in front of us. Turner has been a key supporter of the Houston equal rights ordinance and backs the Rebuild Houston program as a dedicated funding source for streets and drainage.
On pensions, Turner goes beyond the other candidates by calling for comprehensive reform of the city's finances. Every time Parker hit firefighters on pensions, they seemed to push back just as hard. At this point, it is difficult to see how Steve Costello or Bill King would be more successful. Instead, Turner wants to bring everyone to the table so that folks don't feel like they're being turned into a target.
He attempted that strategy during the last legislative session by backing a deal that would lower the city's payments in the short-term but raise the long-term liability. When he met with the editorial board, Turner said the failed bill was supposed to serve as a stop-gap to help bridge the city's continuing budget crisis while getting both sides talking. We opposed the plan then and we're still skeptical now. However, as someone with support from the city's three key public unions, Turner is well prepared to bring consensus to a pension solution that closes annual funding gaps and pays down the city's liabilities.
We can only guess what political machinations led the city's three key public unions to endorse Turner before meeting with any other candidate. And time has obscured the scandals that bogged down Turner during his last two mayoral campaigns. Despite all the baggage that comes with a long-time legislator, Turner still stands as the candidate best suited for City Hall.
Former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia entered the race with high hopes. He had served on City Council, had the executive experience of the sheriff's department and routinely demonstrated a sharp policy focus with his mental health advocacy. However, Garcia stumbled on the campaign trail, routinely answering deep questions with shallow responses. Reports of deaths, violence and ignored whistleblowers at the county jail also undermine his record as chief law enforcement officer.
Councilman Steve Costello similarly provides a balance of political service, executive experience and policy chops. His engineer's mentality can be a welcome presence around the horseshoe, but his technocratic style, so much like Mayor Parker, will mean more of the same if he's elected mayor. Houston needs a new operating style at City Hall and Costello can't promise that.
Of all the other candidates, Bill King provides the sharpest critique and greatest insight into the way our city is run. He's traveled across the city, and written dozens of Chronicle columns, arguing about how Houston's problems stem from a failure of management. His advocacy for better organization within City Hall, and focus on measurable results, is reminiscent of former mayor Bill White's first campaign. However, as mayor he would be the antithesis of Turner when it comes to uniting people around a cause. It isn't enough to be right - you also have to get the votes. Nevertheless, any future mayor would be wise to give King a seat at the table.
As Houston continues to grow, we need a leader who can connect our diverse city and build bridges that link wise policy with smart implementation. This leader needs to be able to see the big picture and understand how each gear of our churning metropolis connects to the greater whole. From his perch in Austin, Turner has spent decades watching the political process turn at City Hall. We believe that this experience leaves him well prepared to keep it running smoothly.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1155,83.48,66.52,19.26,43.44,18.93,25.63,83.55,60.52,47.79,8.31,4.68,0,0.87,0.61,2.16,0.69,3.64,16.36,9.09,1.39,14.03,6.49,4.76,6.15,1.13,12.73,7.53,3.72,7.71,1.82,1.9,4.16,12.9,0.87,11.86,2.68,1.21,2.25,1.99,0.26,4.07,0.26,3.81,2.68,1.13,0.26,0.09,0.17,0,0.09,0,0,13.25,4.16,0.61,0.09,0.43,0.52,1.21,8.23,0.09,0,0,2.42,5.37,5.19,0,0.17,4.42,0.09,0.09,3.29,1.3,0.09,0.61,0.17,0,0,0.17,0,0,0,0.09,0.61,0.26,0.52,0.17,0.09,0,0.35,0.61,0.26,4.42,8.83,0.61,1.9,5.11,0.87,0.43,0.35,3.98,2.34,6.58,1.65,0,0,0,0,0,14.81,5.02,4.16,0.26,0,3.2,2.16,0,0.61,0,0,0,0.26,3.11,3.03,3.01,3.24,2.5,-2.75,-0.75,0.02,-0.04,-0.84,0.43,0.78,0.61,0.17,0.26,0,0.43,0,0.78,0,0,0,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.57,1.22,20.19,155.84,0.95,242.42,0.87,329,3.12,147.19,1.21,77.92,0.09,329,1.21,606.06,0,311.69,0,17.32,0,8.66,0,17.32,190.48,147.19,17.32,8.66,77.92,0,173.16,60.61,8.66,34.63,0,0,0,103.9,8.66,103.9,0,17.32,8.66,0.95,1,0,0.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,1

In one of a series of Twitter messages, Mayor Annise Parker, who is openly gay, called her fellow Rice University alumnus a ‚Äúhypocrite‚Äù over a television commercial Berkman recorded for the anti-HERO Campaign for Houston PAC.
The ordinance, which awaits voter approval Nov. 3, bans discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity. In the spot, Berkman attacks what he calls the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù that he says ‚Äúwould allow troubled men to enter women's public restrooms, showers and locker rooms.‚Äù Berkman, who notes he has a wife and four daughters, says the ordinance would ‚Äúput them in harm's way‚Äù and is ‚Äújust wrong.‚Äù

U.S. wins another Olympic qualifier
Substitute Jerome Kiesewetter sparked the offense with a goal and an assist in the second half, and the United States beat Panama 4-0 in CONCACAF Olympic qualifying on a rainy night in Commerce City, Colorado.
Already through to the semifinal round, the Americans didn't have much to play for and rested several of their starters. Scoreless at halftime, the U.S. caught a break early in the second half when Panama defender Fidel Escobar knocked in a crossing shot. Kiesewetter then scored three minutes later and Jordan Morris right after that.
Luis Gil wrapped up the scoring by converting a penalty kick, helping the Americans advance out of Group A with a 3-0 record. Canada was second.

ESPN limits plugs for DraftKings
LAS VEGAS ‚Äî ESPN is cutting sponsored DraftKings elements from within its shows but not commercials from the daily fantasy sports site. That‚Äôs according to ESPN Outside the Lines host Bob Ley, who revealed the shift during his show Tuesday.
The change comes as daily fantasy sports behemoths DraftKings and FanDuel respond to reports a DraftKings employee may have accessed valuable company data before winning second place in a FanDuel contest, an incident likened to possible insider trading. The companies say there‚Äôs no evidence anyone misused internal data.
ESPN says in a statement Tuesday‚Äôs change affected DraftKings billboards appearing during news shows, the clips saying a segment was ‚Äúbrought to you by‚Äù the company, calling the removal a standard procedure ‚Äúto avoid any suggestion of influence on our coverage.‚Äù

10/6/15,18,National,Houston transgender bathroom bill debate centers on differing definitions of 'men' ,"
HOUSTON ‚Äî The noisy debate over this city's Proposition 1 has centered on whether it would allow men to use women's public restrooms, which boils down to how you define ""men"" and ""women.""
In a battle that has ranged from bathroom etiquette to gender rights to constitutional debates over religious freedom, a key skirmish broke out after former Houston Astros baseball all-star Lance Berkman appeared in an ad saying that the Nov. 3 ballot measure would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms,"" and the Yes on 1 campaign fired back.
""Prop. 1 will NOT allow men to enter women's restrooms,"" says a post on the website Houston Unites, the group supporting Proposition 1.
By ""men,"" however, the campaign is excluding biological men who identify as women. Proposition 1 would ban discrimination in public accommodations such as restrooms based on 15 characteristics, including gender identity.
In other words, anyone who tries to stop a biological man who identifies as a woman from using a women's room would be in violation and could face fines of up to $5,000, if the measure succeeds.
""Obviously, when somebody identifies as transgender, it's a transitioning process that we don't really know where people are at in that,"" said Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites. ""Ultimately, people who live and work in society as women should be using the women's restroom, and people who live and work in society as men should use the men's restroom.""
Proposition 1 allows voters to decide the fate of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the hotly contested law pushed by Houston Mayor Annise Parker, a Democrat, and passed by the Houston City Council last year. The law was moved to the Nov. 3 ballot after a signature-gathering campaign that went to the Texas Supreme Court.
Before the ordinance, Houston relied on Texas and federal law, which do not include gender identity. Framing the debate
By refusing to exclude access to public restrooms based on gender identity, as some other Texas jurisdictions have done, the mayor and City Council triggered a public outcry against the ordinance led by local pastors and backed by social conservatives. The hotly contested ballot measure also has overshadowed a lively mayor's race and other citywide elections with a media blitz as both sides battle to define the debate.
The Houston Unites campaign has fought to move the discussion away from restrooms and into the realm of discrimination prevention, noting that Proposition 1 also protects against discrimination based on traits such as race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation.
The campaign's first television ad featured two local clergy in support of the measure. ""As Christians, we believe in treating others as we want to be treated,"" one of them said.
Houston Unites has also touted the support of business groups such as the Greater Houston Partnership and Visit Houston. A full- page ad published last weekend in the Houston Chronicle signed by 36 businesses argued that Proposition 1 is needed to preserve ""Houston's reputation as a friendly, welcoming place."" But the Campaign for Houston, which opposes Proposition 1, has countered with hard-hitting videos and posts charging that the measure will make women and girls vulnerable to attacks in public restrooms by men.
""A man who goes into women's bathrooms, showers and restrooms is not a hero, he is a pervert,"" says one online ad by the Campaign for Houston, whose slogan is ""No men in women's bathrooms.""
Campaign for Houston spokesman Jared Woodfill noted that the law doesn't say that men who identify as women have to dress like women, making it nearly impossible for business owners to figure out whether biological men entering women's rooms are transgender or not.
""The language for gender identity under the ordinance doesn't say you have to dress like a female. You only have to identify as a female,"" Mr. Woodfill said.
Supporters of Proposition 1 insist that such arguments amount to scare tactics. They point out that it will remain illegal to enter a public restroom to ""harm or harass"" others.
The Yes on Prop 1 campaign also has the clear financial advantage, raising $1.2 million since Aug. 12, more than twice as much as the Campaign for Houston, according to campaign finance reports submitted Monday.
Another plus for supporters is that the ballot language never mentions public restrooms, but rather asks voters whether they are in favor of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, ""which prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing"" based on the 15 characteristics.
No recent polling on the issue has been released, but Mr. Carlbom said, ""When people look at the question as it is on the ballot and are asked the question, 'Do they support an equal rights ordinance?' we do very, very well.""
As long as voters understand the connection between Proposition 1 and the public restroom issue, however, Mr. Woodfill is confident the nays will prevail.

10/6/15,18,B,Equal rights law advocates raise $1.26 million - Campaign finance reports show supporters of HERO more than doubled donations collected by foes in ballot measure battle ,"See an interactive on campaign funding as well as videos and Q&As with the candidates at HoustonChronicle.com/Election2015
Supporters of Houston's contentious equal rights ordinance raked in $1.26 million during seven weeks of official fundraising, more than doubling opponents' efforts and fueling a fierce and frenzied media campaign to court voters before the law hits the November ballot.
In campaign finance reports filed Monday that reflect late summer totals, both sides spent more than $550,000, largely on dueling TV and radio ads. But the more than $521,000 that supporters of the law still had left in campaign coffers as of Sept. 25 dwarfed the $58,000 that opponents reported in cash-on-hand.
That the fight over the city's embattled equal rights ordinance is drawing significant money comes as little surprise. Following more than a year of litigation, City Council opted in August to send the law to the ballot after a Texas Supreme Court ruling ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it to voters. Campaigns that had long waited in the wings quickly took centerstage.
Opponents object to the protections the law extends to gay and transgender residents and allege that it allows male sexual predators dressed in drag to enter women's restrooms. Boosters of the law say it provides basic and necessary local protections for residents and warn that a repeal would dramatically harm Houston's image and economy.
The vote is likely to be close, according to Rice University political scientist Bob Stein.
""This is a matter of messaging now,"" Stein said. ""The fundraising puts the supporters of HERO in a competitive if not advantage position.""
In the race to succeed Mayor Annise Parker, total fundraising came in relatively low for a contest that has been on track to be the most expensive in recent city history.
The eight mayoral contenders who filed reports Monday raised a total of at least $1.8 million over nearly three months, while in the first half of the year candidates took in more than $7 million.
In all, they spent more than $4 million from July through late September, leaving them with more than $3 million in the bank collectively and less than a month to go before the Nov. 3 election.
Garcia leads list
At this point in the race, candidates' cash on hand is key, local political analyst Nancy Sims said.
""They need to have all their funds in place for their get-out-the-vote efforts,"" Sims said, noting that four of the candidates have money to deploy.
Despite sustaining recent political attacks from many of his rivals, former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia again led the pack in fundraising, receiving nearly $585,000 in contributions for the period ending Sept. 25.
Having already raised more than $1.5 million in the first half of the year, Garcia closed the reporting period with the most available cash: more than $831,000. He reported spending more than $1 million since midsummer.
State Rep. Sylvester Turner also crossed the $500,000 threshold, reporting $527,000 in contributions and almost $1.3 million spent in nearly three months, leaving him with $507,000.
City Councilman Stephen Costello, whose fundraising rivaled Garcia's in the first half of the year, took in another $267,000.
He has $697,000 in the bank after spending $871,000 during the reporting period.
Houstonians for the Future, an independent committee organized to support Costello, has been running television ads on his behalf.
As for former City Attorney Ben Hall, he again raised and spent little - $58,000 and $111,000, respectively - leaving him with roughly $769,000.
Former Kemah Mayor Bill King and former Congressman Chris Bell, on the other hand, closed the reporting period with less than half a million in the bank.
King raised $284,000 and loaned himself an additional $150,000.
Having spent some $627,000 in late summer, King reported $322,000 in available cash.
Bell posted comparatively low fundraising numbers, raising $127,000 and spending $240,000 during the reporting period.
He heads into the home-stretch of the campaign with just $92,000 remaining.
A special purpose political action committee supporting Bell, Houston Forward, reported having some $10,000 on hand.
'Not intimidated'
Meanwhile, businesswoman Victoria Lane raised $11,000 and loaned herself another $9,000. After spending about $14,000, she closed the period with some $5,000 in the bank.
Businessman Marty McVey raised just $45 and spent $4,000. His finance report did not list cash on hand.
In the battle over the city's equal rights ordinance, Jared Woodfill, spokesman for opponents, said the campaign is unfazed by supporters' significant fundraising totals.
Opponents reported a $100,000 donation from conservative developer Al Hartman, $25,000 from Harris County Commissioner Jack Cagle and $5,000 from Houston state Rep. Gary Elkins, among others. Longtime anti-gay activist Steve Hotze also loaned the campaign $50,000.
""We're absolutely not intimidated at this point,"" Woodfill said. ""I believe the momentum is in our favor and clearly this is an ordinance that the people in Houston don't want.""
In a news release, the Houston Unites campaign said it expected to spend $2 million before the November election. The campaign said 80 percent of its nearly 700 donors are Houston residents.
But its efforts were also fueled by big-ticket contributions from national groups and figures.
Close vote expected The Washington, D.C.- based Human Rights Campaign contributed more than $200,000, and New York philanthropist Jon Stryker, a frequent donor to LGBT causes, pitched in $100,000. Colorado's Gill Action and New York-based American Unity Fund, both LGBT advocacy groups, donated a combined $200,000.
Campaign manager Richard Carlbom, in a written statement, said the group had ""certainly done well on the money front so far.""
""But, there is a great sense of urgency around fundraising this week and next,"" Carlbom said. ""We know from past ballot campaigns that equal rights opponents spend significant dollars in the final weeks. We must remain competitive with them in what will, no doubt, be a close election.""",Houston Unites,1,977,94.81,43.68,55.14,17.84,18.43,25.59,83.52,56.29,43.4,5.22,2.56,0.1,0.41,0,1.23,0.61,2.66,15.86,8.5,7.06,15.15,3.38,3.28,6.24,0.61,8.8,6.65,8.5,7.68,1.23,0.92,5.83,8.9,0.2,7.57,0.72,0.82,0.41,1.13,0.51,4.09,0,2.15,0.92,1.13,0.2,0,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,10.34,5.32,1.13,0,0.61,0.31,1.54,5.02,0,0,0.31,1.54,4.61,4.3,0.1,0.2,6.86,0.2,0.31,3.38,3.58,0,1.13,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,0.1,0,0.41,0.1,0.41,0,0,0,0.2,0.51,0.1,2.56,10.03,0.2,2.15,7.47,0.31,0,0.1,5.94,4.71,1.94,0.41,0.1,0,0.1,0,0,24.05,6.14,8.8,0,0,1.43,7.68,0,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0,3.06,3.16,2.87,3.09,2.34,-2.5,-1.2,0.03,-0.86,-1.49,0.41,0.82,0,0.31,1.43,0,0.61,0,0.31,0,0,0.1,1.23,0.1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.94,0.81,13.73,122.82,0.61,133.06,0.82,143.3,1.23,133.06,0.72,51.18,-0.1,348,1.43,388.95,0,266.12,-0.72,10.24,0.1,10.24,0,30.71,102.35,92.12,0,10.24,102.35,0.41,92.12,71.65,20.47,10.24,0,0,0,71.65,61.41,40.94,30.71,20.47,0,0.31,1,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.1,0.1,0,1
10/6/15,18,National,Houston transgender bathroom bill debate centers on differing definitions of 'men' ,"
HOUSTON ‚Äî The noisy debate over this city's Proposition 1 has centered on whether it would allow men to use women's public restrooms, which boils down to how you define ""men"" and ""women.""
In a battle that has ranged from bathroom etiquette to gender rights to constitutional debates over religious freedom, a key skirmish broke out after former Houston Astros baseball all-star Lance Berkman appeared in an ad saying that the Nov. 3 ballot measure would ""allow troubled men who claim to be women to enter women's bathrooms, showers and locker rooms,"" and the Yes on 1 campaign fired back.
""Prop. 1 will NOT allow men to enter women's restrooms,"" says a post on the website Houston Unites, the group supporting Proposition 1.
By ""men,"" however, the campaign is excluding biological men who identify as women. Proposition 1 would ban discrimination in public accommodations such as restrooms based on 15 characteristics, including gender identity.
In other words, anyone who tries to stop a biological man who identifies as a woman from using a women's room would be in violation and could face fines of up to $5,000, if the measure succeeds.
""Obviously, when somebody identifies as transgender, it's a transitioning process that we don't really know where people are at in that,"" said Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites. ""Ultimately, people who live and work in society as women should be using the women's restroom, and people who live and work in society as men should use the men's restroom.""
Proposition 1 allows voters to decide the fate of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the hotly contested law pushed by Houston Mayor Annise Parker, a Democrat, and passed by the Houston City Council last year. The law was moved to the Nov. 3 ballot after a signature-gathering campaign that went to the Texas Supreme Court.
Before the ordinance, Houston relied on Texas and federal law, which do not include gender identity. Framing the debate
By refusing to exclude access to public restrooms based on gender identity, as some other Texas jurisdictions have done, the mayor and City Council triggered a public outcry against the ordinance led by local pastors and backed by social conservatives. The hotly contested ballot measure also has overshadowed a lively mayor's race and other citywide elections with a media blitz as both sides battle to define the debate.
The Houston Unites campaign has fought to move the discussion away from restrooms and into the realm of discrimination prevention, noting that Proposition 1 also protects against discrimination based on traits such as race, ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation.
The campaign's first television ad featured two local clergy in support of the measure. ""As Christians, we believe in treating others as we want to be treated,"" one of them said.
Houston Unites has also touted the support of business groups such as the Greater Houston Partnership and Visit Houston. A full- page ad published last weekend in the Houston Chronicle signed by 36 businesses argued that Proposition 1 is needed to preserve ""Houston's reputation as a friendly, welcoming place."" But the Campaign for Houston, which opposes Proposition 1, has countered with hard-hitting videos and posts charging that the measure will make women and girls vulnerable to attacks in public restrooms by men.

As long as voters understand the connection between Proposition 1 and the public restroom issue, however, Mr. Woodfill is confident the nays will prevail.
""Once folks are educated about what this ordinance means to them in terms of public safety and males being able to enter female restrooms, they overwhelmingly reject it,"" Mr. Woodfill said.",Campaign for Houston ,1,862,89.84,67.89,20.47,13.95,24.63,25.87,82.13,56.15,44.55,6.26,2.67,0,0.46,0.35,0.12,0.7,3.6,12.41,8.24,3.13,15.55,5.8,2.67,7.66,1.16,12.53,5.22,2.32,7.31,1.04,0.81,5.57,11.83,0.58,11.14,2.09,2.09,1.04,1.28,0.35,4.18,0,3.6,1.51,2.09,0.93,0.35,0.58,0.35,0.23,0,0,17.87,8.7,0.7,0.7,1.62,0.23,3.25,9.28,0.12,0,2.32,2.44,3.94,3.36,0.23,0.35,3.36,0.35,0.7,1.51,0.7,0.46,0.81,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0.81,0.12,0,0,0.12,0,0.23,0.46,0,3.02,7.08,0.35,1.28,5.22,0.23,0.12,0,1.97,2.44,3.48,1.28,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,17.75,4.52,6.5,0.12,0,2.2,4.41,0,0.35,0,0,0,0.12,3.72,3.94,3.26,3.44,3.01,-3.38,-1.74,-0.37,-0.99,-1.46,0.23,0.93,0.12,0.46,1.28,0.46,0.7,0,0.35,0.23,0.23,0.23,1.28,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.15,0.98,16.44,162.41,1.39,232.02,-1.04,127.61,1.28,150.81,1.04,69.61,-0.46,232.02,-0.35,475.64,0,34.8,-0.12,11.6,0.12,11.6,0,69.61,69.61,46.4,23.2,23.2,69.61,0,104.41,127.61,23.2,81.21,0,0,0,127.61,46.4,104.41,92.81,23.2,11.6,0.81,1,0.46,2.09,0,0,0,0.12,0.12,0.58,0.46,0,0.23,0.12,1

10/2/15,18,B,For District J - Mike Laster attracted a serious challenger but has earned his third term at City Hall. ,"
Mike Laster may be the only incumbent council member to face a serious challenger this year who wasn't inspired by the Houston equal rights ordinance. Taking a charge at the two-term representative from District J is Jim Bigham, the current president of the Sharpstown Civic Association - a position once held by Laster. In a meeting with the editorial board, Bigham explained that while he once supported Laster, 54, he now feels that the councilman doesn't adequately represent local needs.
""I just believe that we need a stronger voice for southwest Houston,"" Bigham said. ""There have been a number of issues that the community has reached out to the council member and asked for his support, and we did not get that support.""
On his website, Bigham lays out in detail the specifics of where he sees Laster going off course, such as problems with tax increment reinvestment zones and disagreements on the city animal regulations. However, when viewed against the backdrop of citywide concerns, these political punches land softly. The race between the two looks all too much like the insider politics of a neighborhood association dragged onto a district-wide ballot.
There's more to District J than Sharpstown.
The southwest district, bordered by the Westpark Toll Road , Southwest Freeway, Loop 610 West and Beltway 8, might as well serve as Houston's Ellis Island. More than 70 different nationalities are represented across the area and less than one-third of the residents speak English at home. Poverty is pervasive, and prevalent apartment complexes pose plenty of challenges for safety and providing city services - the whole district is about three times as densely populated as the rest of Houston.
However, successful single-family neighborhoods dot the district. Laster calls them ""rowboats of prosperity inside a lake of economic challenges.""
This district has a deep need for important constituent services, and Laster has dedicated his office to providing them. From working with the Urban Land Institute on redesigning Richmond to helping Gulfton youth collaborate on creating a skatepark, Laster puts his longtime City Hall expertise to good use.
In addition to his time on the Sharpstown Civic Association, Laster has worked as a senior city attorney and as former chair of the Sharpstown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone. He was a key proponent of the Houston equal rights ordinance - an important tool for his diverse district. On pensions, Laster says that we need a new system for new hires at the Houston Fire Department, but also warns against cuts that could drive needed public safety workers to retire.
Besides Bigham, Laster faces two other challengers: Dung Le, who said he is running as a bridge to connect minority voters, and Manny Berrera, a former City Hall staffer perhaps best known for his bizarre anti-gay tirades in the comment sections of local political blogs.
Laster has earned his third term at City Hall, but we hope to see Bigham run again in the next election.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,488,93.95,52.28,42.01,74.58,23.24,28.48,81.15,58.81,44.26,6.56,4.51,0.2,0.82,0,2.66,0.41,2.05,15.78,9.43,2.05,15.57,4.3,3.89,5.74,0.61,11.68,6.76,4.3,7.58,2.66,2.25,2.87,9.43,0.61,8.61,1.23,0.2,1.43,0.82,0,4.1,0,5.12,4.3,0.82,0.61,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,10.86,3.28,1.23,0,0.2,0,1.64,6.15,0,0,0,2.66,3.48,3.07,0,0.41,6.56,0.2,1.02,4.51,1.02,0,0.61,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,1.02,0.2,0.61,0.2,0.41,0,0.41,0.61,0.61,3.28,10.86,0.2,1.64,8.61,0.61,0,0.2,5.33,3.89,4.51,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,13.52,4.3,5.33,0,0,0.82,3.07,0,0.61,0,0.2,0,0.2,2.9,2.8,2.78,2.8,2.17,-1.76,0.21,1.21,-0.38,0.4,0.82,0.82,0.61,0.2,0.82,0,0.41,0,0.41,0,0,0.2,0.61,0.2,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.2,1.86,1.14,14.01,143.44,1.02,204.92,0.61,122.95,1.02,184.43,1.23,61.48,-0.2,409.84,0,327.87,0,184.43,-0.82,0,0,20.49,0,61.48,245.9,61.48,0,0,81.97,-0.61,40.98,40.98,20.49,61.48,0,0,0,0,20.49,81.97,0,0,0,1.02,1,0,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.41,1

11/30/15,19,Letters to the Editor,"Letters to the editor for Nov. 30, 2015 ","Put focus on Obama‚Äôs background
It has come to my attention again just how far the mainstream media leans to the left, even though they should by all rights be on an even keep. I see they wish to hammer Ben Carson over things that were said years ago. But when it comes to the current president, they are silent on things pertaining to his background.
Carson even brought up in a news conference about President Obama‚Äôs hidden school records. This was quickly ignored by the press. One must wonder why.
Even after the short form of live birth certificate was brought out, which the authorities at the time said this was all they had. They were very clear there were no other birth documents on file at the time. Then a couple of years later, they miraculously found a copy of the long form of live birth certificate.
Also, why have no mainstream media ever tried to uncover the reason why so much of his school records have been hidden from public view? His school transcripts are not open to the public. What of his application for college as a foreign student? Then there is the Social Security number issued to Obama from a state he has never lived in his life.
The mainstream media goes after GOP candidates, but will not do likewise to Democrats. If the mainstream media were a ship, they would be in danger of listing so far to port they would sink.
Michial Lawrence, Brazoria ‚ÄòHoly spirit‚Äô is Jehovah‚Äôs power
Mr. (G.L.) Kidwell‚Äôs reference (letters, Nov. 14) to Acts 2 confirms my point. The holy spirit is Jehovah‚Äôs power sent forth to accomplish his will and purposes, as in creation, beginning with his son (Rev. 3:14). He has made it operative on people in many cases, such as to inspire scripture, to enable Judge Sampson to destroy Dagon‚Äôs temple (Judges 16:28), to empower the 120 (Acts 1:15) with immediate ability to speak in the languages of those gathered in Jerusalem for Pentecost celebration.
This was done to establish the transfer of favor from the Jewish nation, and recognize the Christian congregation, with Christ Jesus as head, as God‚Äôs chosen people (1 Peter 2:9-10). Thus the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù would travel back with these ones upon their return to their territories.
Holy spirit is ours for the asking ‚Äî not a person, but power beyond what is normal in our quest to serve our God, follow his son‚Äôs example, and in understanding the scriptures.
Holy spirit is indeed personified in some instances, just as ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù is spoken of as having children (Luke 7:35).
At Revelation 3:10-11, Jesus in his glorified form states he has a God. (The red letter edition is good for clarification that Jesus is speaking).
Jesus honored his father (and God) and obeyed him, because of his love for him (John 14:31). He paid the ultimate price, buying back our original destiny, everlasting life.
We show our love for both in doing what they say (Luke 6:46, John 14:31). Russell Amundsen, Lake Jackson
HERO opponents were not ‚Äòhaters‚Äô
I‚Äôm often thankful for the distance separating myself from Houston and all the craziness there. The Brazosport area may not be Mayberry, and Houston might not quite be Chicago or San Francisco ‚Äî yet, but the differences are still vast. One such time of thanks was during their recent squabble over the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO).
Fortunately, with the push of a button on the TV remote or click of a mouse, I‚Äôve been able to turn off the madness when the racket gets too much to handle. But never fear, leave it to The Facts Managing Editor Michael Morris to shove it back in my face. First he runs a poll on Facebook asking opinions about the failed ordinance. Then he writes a editorial (column, Nov. 11) telling us how everybody opposed to HERO is a ‚Äúhater.‚Äù
Why should I be surprised? We all know that anyone who speaks negatively about Obama is a racist. Only stands to reason that anyone against HERO is a hater, or as Mayor Parker put it, a transphobe.
My take on all this varies considerably from the likes of Mr. Morris. It‚Äôs not that people in general are racist, transphobes and haters. They‚Äôre just sick and tired of having an endless supply of special interests groups shove their agendas down their throats. You take a step back to make room for one offended group and before you know it, you‚Äôre on your butt getting stomped by the stampede. Maybe, just maybe ‚Äî enough is enough.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,775,71.26,71.39,26.02,23.49,16.85,16.52,85.55,63.87,52.26,10.84,7.23,1.16,1.03,0.52,2.45,1.94,3.61,14.71,7.35,3.48,14.84,7.87,5.94,5.16,1.55,14.32,4.13,3.35,4.65,1.42,1.42,2.06,10.06,1.42,8.65,2.19,1.68,1.03,1.94,0.13,3.1,0,5.03,2.58,2.32,1.68,0.9,0.65,0.13,0.26,0,0,14.71,5.81,0.26,0.39,0.65,1.68,1.81,9.68,0.39,0,0,3.1,1.68,1.03,0.52,0.13,6.32,0.26,0.13,2.19,0.39,3.35,0.9,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.77,0.26,0.26,0.39,0,0.52,0.65,4.77,9.42,0.65,2.06,6.19,0.77,0.13,0,3.35,3.61,4.26,0.77,0.52,0.52,0,0,0,18.97,5.94,4.9,0.39,0,1.94,5.81,0,0.13,0,0.26,0.13,0.39,2.53,2.77,2.48,2.61,2.27,-1.48,-0.57,0.52,0.02,-0.34,0,0.26,0.26,0.13,0.39,0.26,0.52,0,0.77,0,2.06,0,0.52,0.13,1.29,0,0,0.13,0,0,0,0.13,0.13,0.26,2.58,1.32,17.39,206.45,0.26,270.97,0.39,283.87,2.58,245.16,1.94,103.23,-0.9,193.55,1.03,335.48,0,129.03,-0.39,219.35,2.19,12.9,0,38.71,77.42,141.94,25.81,12.9,103.23,0.13,193.55,64.52,12.9,51.61,0,0,0,103.23,12.9,129.03,12.9,25.81,12.9,0.52,1,0,0.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

It stands to reason that there would be a formal contract governing the $250 million deal between the state's Major Events Reimbursement Program and the Circuit of the Americas. After all, written contracts are the standard way of doing business between individuals, businesses or governments.
So it came as a surprise when Gov. Greg Abbott's office and Bobby Epstein, chairman of the Circuit of the Americas, in response to our question to see a written contract, told us there was no formal contract. There should be. It would have avoided the confusion that currently is endangering the future of Formula One in Austin.

Voters soundly defeated the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance in a Nov. 3 referendum. In a Two Views commentary, Republican political consultant Matt Mackowiak called the ordinance's defeat a victory for public safety. Democratic consultant Glenn Smith, director of Austin's Progress Texas PAC, criticized the opposition's ""no men in women's bathrooms"" strategy, writing, ""their real concern is not bathroom security. They want a world safe only for people like themselves.""

Three out of four Austin police officers live outside the city they were hired to protect. This is a problem. To correct it, city officials are considering offering financial incentives to encourage more Austin police officers to live in the city.
The American-Statesman's editorial board awaits details of any benefits the city might offer its police officers, as well as calculations about the possible costs before taking a position on this latest manifestation of a long-debated issue. But in the past, the board has supported moves to encourage Austin's public safety workers to live inside the city.

American-Statesman reporters Lilly Rockwell and Christian McDonald recently took a close look at the numbers behind the wage gap for city of Austin employees. The average woman in the city government's workforce, excluding first responders, made 96 cents for every $1 a man earned. In nearly half the city jobs reviewed, women earned more than men.
But digging a little deeper shows there is still some work to do. The city government's workforce is overwhelmingly male, especially in upper management and other higher-paying positions. And while women by and large are paid similarly to men in the same jobs, women are overrepresented in lower-wage positions.

For more than 10 years, Community First! has been on a mission to provide chronically homeless individuals with permanent housing in a caring environment.
We visited the homeless center in eastern Travis County, envisioned and run by Mobile Loaves & Fishes. Amid ongoing construction, residents are slowly moving in. After a decade in the making, the fact that this project is coming to fruition is reason for many to be thankful. Friday, Nov. 27
Angeline Close Scheinbaum, an associate professor of advertising and public relations at the University of Texas, and Julie Irwin, a marketing professor at UT, pondered the future of Black Friday for a Two Views commentary. Close Scheinbaum foresees Black Friday giving way to a Black Weekend as the blending of in-store and online shopping continues. Irwin thinks that stores that cater to shoppers motivated by price, like Best Buy or Wal-Mart, are likely to maintain the Black Friday tradition while higher-end stores such as REI, which closed its stores Friday, slowly retreat from it.

The Texas Department of Public Safety says its troopers treat all motorists equally. As proof it is free of racial profiling, DPS points to more than a decade of annual reports it has published on the race and ethnicity of the drivers state troopers have stopped, warned, ticketed, searched and arrested.
There are flaws in the agency's results, however; its comparison of traffic stops against statewide population percentages of race and ethnicity is misleading. Its reports would be more accurate if DPS tracked what percentage of motorists of a given race are searched, cited or arrested after they are stopped. And that is what legislators should demand of DPS.

11/29/15,19,B,VOTE 2015 - MEET THE CANDIDATES ,"Where they stand on the issues City finances
Houston is facing a projected $126 million budget deficit next fiscal year, largely driven by rising pension costs, which this year topped $350 million, and a nearing spike in debt payments. Houston has also run into a voter-approved revenue cap, which dictates that the city may not increase annual property tax collections by more than the combined rates of inflation and population growth, or 4.5 percent, whichever is lower.
Turner
1 Calls for comprehensive financial reform, attributing the city's financial strain to pension costs, the revenue cap, a nearing spike in city debt payments and the property taxes set aside for economic development in targeted areas known as tax increment reinvestment zones
1 Acknowledges the city must address its rising pension costs but has not specified his plan 1 Favors lifting the revenue cap to allow more public safety spending or to pay down city debt King
1 Considers pension reform the defining issue of the race
1 Favors switching new hires from defined- benefit to defined-contribution plans. To address the city's $3.2 billion unfunded liability, King would seek legislative approval to offer cash discounts to workers already in the defined-benefit system and issue bonds to cover the remaining gap.
1 Opposes lifting the revenue cap ...
Infrastructure
Funding for Houston's pockmarked roads long came from borrowing. But in 2010, voters approved ReBuild Houston, a pay-as-you- go infrastructure program intended to use a monthly drainage fee paired with three other funding sources to pour billions into fixing the city's roads. The ReBuild model of using data to fix the worst streets first has drawn criticism from residents eager to see their roads repaired. The drainage fee is currently being litigated.
Turner
1 Supports ReBuild Houston and maintains the city needs a dedicated revenue source for infrastructure improvements but says the program could have been better implemented
  King 1 Opposes ReBuild Houston but says he would continue collecting the drainage fee that funds the program and instead use that revenue to finance infrastructure bonds
...
Public safety
A 2014 study found that 21,000 cases with workable leads went uninvestigated the year before, which HPD attributes to a staffing shortage. The police chief has asked for $105 million over five years for a net increase of 590 officers, with a focus on bolstering the agency's investigative unit.
Turner
1 Calls for adding 540 officers by 2020, a plan he says would cost $85 million. Turner would finance the increase by asking voters to modify the revenue cap for public safety spending.

In their own words
Sylvester Turner
1. What three qualities do you think are most important for the Houston mayor to have and why?
1. A track record of getting results - because opinions alone are not enough once you are in the mayor's chair; 2. A demonstrated ability to work with everyone, no matter their politics - because you are the mayor of all the people, not just a few; 3. A vision for Houston - because you cannot lead if you don't know where you are going.
2. Describe a time when you worked with a group to solve a problem. What was your role? How did you settle on your ultimate approach? What was the outcome?
I worked with our Republican leadership in the Texas House of Representatives, my Democratic colleagues and representatives of Texas public employees to make our state's Employee Retirement System actuarially sound. It was costing taxpayers $500 million a year. Over two legislative sessions, we built trust and surrendered hard positions so we could move forward together. House Bill 9 in the last session was authored by the chair of the Appropriations Committee, the chair of the Pension Committee and myself. We succeeded in ensuring the pension fund will become actuarially sound and created a way to pay off the staggering, unfunded liability while keeping our promises to hard-working state employees.
3. Pick a major policy problem or crisis that Mayor Annise Parker has faced during the past two years and explain how you would have approached it differently and how that reflects your approach to the mayor's office. Explain not just how you would have addressed the problem externally, but also how you would have worked with council members and staff internally to get their buy-in.
I have great respect for Mayor Parker. My campaign is looking forward, not backward, so I will decline to comment on her work. I will say that after 26 years in the Legislature, with the majority of my service in leadership roles, I have deep experience in working with legislative bodies across party lines and philosophical divides. It's easy to make assumptions about and question the motives of people you don't know - so as a legislator and a leader, I have worked to get to know my colleagues personally. And my working assumption is that all elected representatives are doing what they believe is in the best interest of their constituents. I look forward to working with the members of City Council as I did with the members of the Texas House.
4. Describe a time when a decision you made was attacked and how you handled it. How did you communicate with stakeholders? What was the resolution?
In the 2005 legislative session, the Children's Health Program-CHIP - was drastically cut, leaving many kids without health care. In 2007, I was determined to see that funds were restored to CHIP. The Republican speaker told me that no Republicans would vote for that. I told him, I would get it done. I crafted House Bill 109 to increase CHIP enrollment and then engaged Republican legislators like John Davis and Susan King to help. The bill passed out of committee 8-1. On the House floor, we agreed that no amendments would be made to the bill, either to increase or decrease funding. For nearly five hours, I and the other supporters fended off amendments from both Democrats and Republicans, sticking to our agreement. I was determined to pass this bill and changing it could have led one side or the other to vote against it. I argued ""Let us not sacrifice the good for the perfect."" In the end, HB 109 passed with 134 votes, almost equally divided between Democrats and Republicans. The Senate passed the bill, the governor signed it and, as a result, 130,000 more children received access to health care.
5. In August, the first day of school at the Houston Independent School District's new Arabic Immersion Magnet School was met with protests, and demonstrators said the school was anti-American and that immigrants should be assimilated. Had you been mayor at the time, how would you have handled that situation?
Everyone has a right to their own views, but no one has a right to frighten and intimidate children and their parents - at our schools or anywhere else. As mayor, I would work with the school district and our police department to protect our parents and kids without interfering with the rights of citizens to peacefully protest.
Bill King
1. What three qualities do you think are most important for the Houston mayor to have and why?
1. Pragmatic, not ideological; 2. Open to hearing opposing and diverse views on subjects; 3. Not afraid to make decisions.
2. Describe a time when you worked with a group to solve a problem. What was your role? How did you settle on your ultimate approach? What was the outcome?
I chaired the task force that redrafted the hurricane evacuation plans after Hurricane Rita. We had hundreds of meetings with stakeholders and experts to identify what went wrong and what solutions were viable. New plans were eventually drawn up. The evacuation for Hurricane Ike several years later went much smoother. However, our work also led eventually to the discussion about some kind of surge protection system because we also concluded there was no evacuation solution that would result in no loss of life.
3. Pick a major policy problem or crisis that Mayor Annise Parker has faced during the past two years and explain how you would have approached it differently and how that reflects your approach to the mayor's office. Explain not just how you would have addressed the problem externally, but also how you would have worked with council members and staff internally to get their buy-in.
The mayor has punted on dealing with pension reform, the most serious long-term issue facing the City. Instead of proposing a comprehensive solution, she focused entirely on the fire fighter plan which actually is in the best financial shape for what I must conclude were political reasons. In my opinion she should have come forward with a comprehensive proposed solution and then vetted that with the various stakeholders. That is not to suggest that everyone would have ultimately agreed on a plan. But at least when she went to the Legislature there would have been a process and a comprehensive proposal on the table.
4. Describe a time when a decision you made was attacked and how you handled it. How did you communicate with stakeholders? What was the resolution?
When I was the mayor in Kemah, there were many issues regarding parking near the Boardwalk. The city developed a plan to designate a certain area as our Entertainment District and to revise the parking requirements in that area to more realistically reflect the needs associated with the high volume of visitors we had on the weekend. The plan was basically a compromise between the commercial interest associated with the Boardwalk and the adjacent neighborhood. As with any compromise neither side was completely satisfied, but we ultimately implemented the plan and after it was in place for a few months both side realized it was something they could live with.
5. In August, the first day of school at the Houston Independent School District's new Arabic Immersion Magnet School was met with protests, and demonstrators said the school was anti-American and that immigrants should be assimilated. Had you been mayor at the time, how would you have handled that situation?
The mayor's principal responsibility in this situation would be ensure the safety of the students and their families and I believe I would have anticipated this possibility and made sure police were on hand to ensure the protests were peaceful and the students and families were not harassed. My understanding is that the protests were only a one-day event. However, had they persisted I would have called on groups like Interfaith Ministries or the Anti-Defamation League to intervene and seek a reconciliation between the groups.

11/28/15,19,Editorials ,It's Debatable: Arguing Houston gay ordinance - Charles: HERO statute is a flawed ordinance ,"This week, Arnold Loewy and Charles Moster debate the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. Moster is a former litigation attorney in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush presidential administrations who currently has offices in Lubbock and Amarillo. Arnold is the George Killiam Professor of Law at Texas Tech University School of Law.
Charles: HERO statute is a flawed ordinance
An ordinance referred to by proponents as ""HERO"" (which stands for ""Houston Equal Rights Ordinance) was recently placed on the ballot in Houston. The ordinance, on its face, would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity ""in city employment, city services, city contracting practices, housing, public accommodations, and private employment."" This ordinance was soundly rejected with 61 percent of voters choosing to vote against. So why would Houstonians vote to reject this ordinance?
Both critics and proponents of HERO have been particularly vocal about the policy issues underlying their respective positions. Proponents of HERO believe the ordinance is necessary to ensure equality. Personally, I do not believe that the issue with HERO and its ultimate rejection by the voters has anything to do with equality. I believe the issue with HERO deals with the public's justified fear of the potential consequences of seemingly benign laws.
Critically, accommodation laws such as HERO are not set out to provide equal treatment. Ordinances such as HERO seek to give ""affirmative accommodations"" that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace. And indeed, HERO seeks accommodation in a way that could intrude upon the safety and comfort of members of the general populace.
The largest complaint with these so-called accommodation laws is that the sexual orientation/gender-identity provision of the ordinance would allow anyone who identifies as female to enter women's restrooms. This means anyone would be allowed to enter into the women's restrooms ‚Äî sex offenders, predators, you name it. Of course, the law doesn't intend to do this. However the reality is that HERO could potentially provide protection for unscrupulous people with ill-intended motives to enter a bathroom, claim to identify as a woman and wreak havoc on the innocent.
Further, HERO is a flawed ordinance with issues that predate the referendum vote. HERO was originally passed by the Houston City Council. After HERO was challenged through the court system, the Texas Supreme Court overturned the ordinance on the basis the City Council lacked the authority to enact such an ordinance. According to the court, ""The legislative power reserved to the people
of Houston is not being honored.""
Essentially, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the people should be free to decide HERO's fate through a referendum. A referendum was held, and the people of Houston decided that HERO was not the ordinance for them. Considering that the Supreme Court of the United States has not decided to extend sexual orientation the same protections that it extends to race, national origin, or religion, there is nothing wrong with Houston voting against this accommodation ordinance.
I certainly believe everyone should be treated with respect. However, we should be wary of how we allow government to encroach into our lives, especially in situations such as this, where the majority is against such encroachments.
Arnold: Ordinance did not force gay acceptance
Mr. Moster tells us that ""accommodation laws such as HERO are not set out to provide equal treatment. Ordinances such as HERO seek to give 'affirmative accommodations' that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace."" Oh really? I closely examined the HERO ordinance and nowhere did I find such a preference.
I never saw a provision that said that when a same sex couple comes into a crowded restaurant that they need to be moved to the head of the line in front of the heterosexual couples who have been waiting. Neither did I see a provision that required that required a grocery store to hire a transgendered person over a better qualified ""straight"" person who had previously applied for the job. Additionally I found no provision calling for an unmarried couple to be able to bump a married couple from an apartment lease that the married couple was in the process of negotiating for.
The reason that I could not find such provisions in HERO is they don't exist. Thus, when Mr. Moster speaks of ""affirmative accommodations that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace,"" he must mean legislatively compelled non-discrimination is unacceptable to the populace. Although that may be true (one can't be sure since such a small proportion of the electorate actually voted), it just shows that voters opposed enforced equality, not that they opposed ""affirmative accommodations.""
Mr. Moster refers to HERO as ""flawed."" So far as I can tell from his description, the only flaw in the ordinance was that under Texas law it should have been presented to the people rather than simply enacted by the town council. That does not render the substantive provisions flawed, it simply says that procedurally they should have been passed in a different manner. I assume, for purposes of argument, that it was within the power of the citizens of Houston to reject HERO. That, however, does not make their rejection wise.
I am glad Mr. Moster believes ""that everyone should be treated with respect."" However, he wants us to be wary of laws that compel such respect (""encroach into our lives"" as he puts it). How is this different from opposition to the Civil Rights act of the Sixties? There, as here, (at least some) people did not extol the virtue of segregation but did extol the right of businesses to practice it. I think if one owns a business serving the public, he should expect government interference with his choice to discriminate.
Finally, the ""potty"" problem. First, there is nothing in the ordinance that addresses the restroom issue. Second, HERO by its terms is subordinate to federal or state laws. Thus, if Texas forbids males (including transgendered males) to use a female restroom, nothing in HERO would countermand that. Finally, even without HERO, a violent predator could dress as a woman and enter a female restroom and wreak the kind of havoc Mr. Moster wrongly assumes could be wrought only under HERO.
Even if Mr. Moster's strained construction of HERO were adopted, the person who would most benefit from it is the cross-dressing transgendered man. It is obvious that such a man would be a whole lot safer in the women's room than the men's room. Since he would do his business in a private stall, it is unlikely that anyone would even know that he wasn't a woman. But if he and his dress and heels had to use the men's room, his safety might well be significantly compromised. So, it is time to dispense with red herrings and address the serious question of whether all minorities should be able to go about their business without fear of discrimination, even if it takes legislatively mandated non-discrimination to accomplish that goal.
Charles: HERO is unwanted government encroachment
I agree legislation is sometimes necessary to fight various forms of discrimination. However, HERO absolutely fails to serve that purpose. Again, I oppose HERO as its unwanted encroachment of government on the daily lives of citizens more than outweighs any potential benefit that the ordinance might bring.
Under HERO, Houstonians can file complaints if they allege that they've been discriminated against. HERO then requires the Houston Inspector General to become involved, and if necessary, open up a criminal case. If a case is filed, it is heard in Houston's municipal court. Small business owners and government agencies stand to be fined $5,000 for every violation of the ordinance. This is a recipe for enhanced government meddling, not to mention the use of local police powers to intimidate and tax citizens and lawful businesses.
Notably, most of the 15 different categories of protected classes in HERO are already federally protected by existing laws and U.S. Supreme Court rulings/precedent. The exceptions, of course, are for gender identity and sexual orientation. This is not inherently bad ‚Äî there is a reason why the Supreme Court has not extended constitutional protections further: because government should be involved in our daily lives to the most limiting extent possible. Should Congress wish to extend constitutional protections to transgender individuals, it can easily do so. Alternatively, the U.S. Supreme Court could take this issue up when properly presented.
Further concerning about HERO is the fact the city of Houston has sought to subvert the will of the voters at every turn. In short, city officials continue to have problems abiding by their city charter. After the referendum was deemed necessary, the Texas Supreme Court had to step in once again, (amid concerns the Mayor of Houston was furthering her political agenda while sidestepping the procedures that are in place to prevent the very same) because the ballot language was unacceptable. The city of Houston's political maneuvering regarding the ballot language is so concerning that state Sen. Paul Bettencourt released a statement calling for the Senate Intergovernmental Affairs Committee to look into the city's ""use of deceptive ballot language and continual erring on election procedure.""
When HERO was first passed by the city council, citizens had organized and petitioned for either a repeal or to have the ordinance put forward to popular vote. On Aug. 4, 2014, the city announced it would not reconsider the ordinance. As the Supreme Court of Texas stated, ""Yet the City Council decided, of its own accord, not to act, disregarding the City Secretary's certification that the petition had enough signatures."" These maneuverings are costing the citizens of Houston considerable time and legal fees given that the Supreme Court of Texas has had to step in three times over the course of the last few months.
Ultimately, the people's right to vote is being protected, and the people of Houston have voiced their preference. Small voter turnout numbers have often been a problem, even with hot-button issues, but the reality is that our democratic process allows for this. For people who feel differently, the only alternative is to get out and vote.
Arnold: Voters misled by imaginary problem
Let's start with a point of agreement. Mr. Moster and I are in accord that ""legislation is sometimes necessary to fight various forms of discrimination. But for some reason, he does not appear to think that preventing discrimination against LGBT people is within that category. Let's examine his reasons for that conclusion.
First, he talks about the ""unwanted encroachment of government on the daily lives of citizens."" What encroachment? If a business doesn't practice discrimination, the law will have no impact on it at all. If it does practice discrimination, it should feel the wrath of government breathing down its neck.
Assume that Bill's delicatessen does not practice discrimination. After John and Mary's wedding they come to Bill's for their post- wedding meal holding hands and are seated. They are followed by George and Sam who have just celebrated their wedding protected by the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (the same-sex marriage case), and they are also seated by Bill who does not practice discrimination.
Now, assume that the two couples instead go to Joe's Sandwich Shop on the other side of the shopping center. Once more John and Mary are seated, But George and Sam are escorted out of the restaurant by Joe, who angrily says: ""We don't need any fag couples in this restaurant!""
If HERO had passed, Joe would have been fined $5,000 for his outrageous conduct. But with HERO defeated, Joe can get away with this sort of behavior scott free. Frankly, this is an illustration of where ""enhanced government meddling,"" if meddling it must be called is totally appropriate and desirable. And, if HERO had passed, what Joe did would not be part of ""lawful business."" And, if he wants to avoid a $5,000 fine, all he would need to do is adhere to the law in the same way that recalcitrant restaurants were forced to do when racial discrimination became unlawful.
Mr. Moster is quite right that Congress could extend statutory (though not constitutional) protection to the LGBT community by simply amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It does seem strange to me that this would be his preferred method of operation. Traditionally, local choice is thought to be far superior to decisions made in far off Washington. After all, the Houston City Council, for all the flaws that Mr. Moster and the Texas Supreme Court find with its procedures, is still the duly elected representative body of the city of Houston.
Providing a preferred constitutional status for sexual preference is certainly an option for the Supreme Court, indeed one it came close to adopting in Obergefell. But that, along with congressional action, should be a last resort, not a first and preferred resort.
If cities like Houston continue to reject equality it may come to either congressional or judicial imposition of equality on the citizens of Houston. But it should not have to come to that.
When the citizens of Indiana realized that if their Religious Freedom Restoration Act (which appeared to allow discrimination against homosexuals) was causing them to lose convention business and ultimately threatened the Super Bowl, the state needed to retrench. Similarly if major events choose not to come to Houston and mention its lack of an equal rights ordinance as its reason for doing so, I suspect that the good citizens of Houston, like those of Indiana, will quickly rectify the situation.

11/28/15,19,Editorial ,It's Debatable: Arguing Houston gay ordinance - Charles: HERO statute is a flawed ordinance ,"This week, Arnold Loewy and Charles Moster debate the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. Moster is a former litigation attorney in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush presidential administrations who currently has offices in Lubbock and Amarillo. Arnold is the George Killiam Professor of Law at Texas Tech University School of Law.
Charles: HERO statute is a flawed ordinance
An ordinance referred to by proponents as ""HERO"" (which stands for ""Houston Equal Rights Ordinance) was recently placed on the ballot in Houston. The ordinance, on its face, would have banned discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity ""in city employment, city services, city contracting practices, housing, public accommodations, and private employment."" This ordinance was soundly rejected with 61 percent of voters choosing to vote against. So why would Houstonians vote to reject this ordinance?
Both critics and proponents of HERO have been particularly vocal about the policy issues underlying their respective positions. Proponents of HERO believe the ordinance is necessary to ensure equality. Personally, I do not believe that the issue with HERO and its ultimate rejection by the voters has anything to do with equality. I believe the issue with HERO deals with the public's justified fear of the potential consequences of seemingly benign laws.
Critically, accommodation laws such as HERO are not set out to provide equal treatment. Ordinances such as HERO seek to give ""affirmative accommodations"" that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace. And indeed, HERO seeks accommodation in a way that could intrude upon the safety and comfort of members of the general populace.
The largest complaint with these so-called accommodation laws is that the sexual orientation/gender-identity provision of the ordinance would allow anyone who identifies as female to enter women's restrooms. This means anyone would be allowed to enter into the women's restrooms ‚Äî sex offenders, predators, you name it. Of course, the law doesn't intend to do this. However the reality is that HERO could potentially provide protection for unscrupulous people with ill-intended motives to enter a bathroom, claim to identify as a woman and wreak havoc on the innocent.
Further, HERO is a flawed ordinance with issues that predate the referendum vote. HERO was originally passed by the Houston City Council. After HERO was challenged through the court system, the Texas Supreme Court overturned the ordinance on the basis the City Council lacked the authority to enact such an ordinance. According to the court, ""The legislative power reserved to the people
of Houston is not being honored.""
Essentially, the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the people should be free to decide HERO's fate through a referendum. A referendum was held, and the people of Houston decided that HERO was not the ordinance for them. Considering that the Supreme Court of the United States has not decided to extend sexual orientation the same protections that it extends to race, national origin, or religion, there is nothing wrong with Houston voting against this accommodation ordinance.
I certainly believe everyone should be treated with respect. However, we should be wary of how we allow government to encroach into our lives, especially in situations such as this, where the majority is against such encroachments.
Arnold: Ordinance did not force gay acceptance
Mr. Moster tells us that ""accommodation laws such as HERO are not set out to provide equal treatment. Ordinances such as HERO seek to give 'affirmative accommodations' that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace."" Oh really? I closely examined the HERO ordinance and nowhere did I find such a preference.
I never saw a provision that said that when a same sex couple comes into a crowded restaurant that they need to be moved to the head of the line in front of the heterosexual couples who have been waiting. Neither did I see a provision that required that required a grocery store to hire a transgendered person over a better qualified ""straight"" person who had previously applied for the job. Additionally I found no provision calling for an unmarried couple to be able to bump a married couple from an apartment lease that the married couple was in the process of negotiating for.
The reason that I could not find such provisions in HERO is they don't exist. Thus, when Mr. Moster speaks of ""affirmative accommodations that are above and beyond what is acceptable to the general populace,"" he must mean legislatively compelled non-discrimination is unacceptable to the populace. Although that may be true (one can't be sure since such a small proportion of the electorate actually voted), it just shows that voters opposed enforced equality, not that they opposed ""affirmative accommodations.""
Mr. Moster refers to HERO as ""flawed."" So far as I can tell from his description, the only flaw in the ordinance was that under Texas law it should have been presented to the people rather than simply enacted by the town council. That does not render the substantive provisions flawed, it simply says that procedurally they should have been passed in a different manner. I assume, for purposes of argument, that it was within the power of the citizens of Houston to reject HERO. That, however, does not make their rejection wise.
I am glad Mr. Moster believes ""that everyone should be treated with respect."" However, he wants us to be wary of laws that compel such respect (""encroach into our lives"" as he puts it). How is this different from opposition to the Civil Rights act of the Sixties? There, as here, (at least some) people did not extol the virtue of segregation but did extol the right of businesses to practice it. I think if one owns a business serving the public, he should expect government interference with his choice to discriminate.
Finally, the ""potty"" problem. First, there is nothing in the ordinance that addresses the restroom issue. Second, HERO by its terms is subordinate to federal or state laws. Thus, if Texas forbids males (including transgendered males) to use a female restroom, nothing in HERO would countermand that. Finally, even without HERO, a violent predator could dress as a woman and enter a female restroom and wreak the kind of havoc Mr. Moster wrongly assumes could be wrought only under HERO.
Even if Mr. Moster's strained construction of HERO were adopted, the person who would most benefit from it is the cross-dressing transgendered man. It is obvious that such a man would be a whole lot safer in the women's room than the men's room. Since he would do his business in a private stall, it is unlikely that anyone would even know that he wasn't a woman. But if he and his dress and heels had to use the men's room, his safety might well be significantly compromised. So, it is time to dispense with red herrings and address the serious question of whether all minorities should be able to go about their business without fear of discrimination, even if it takes legislatively mandated non-discrimination to accomplish that goal.
Charles: HERO is unwanted government encroachment
I agree legislation is sometimes necessary to fight various forms of discrimination. However, HERO absolutely fails to serve that purpose. Again, I oppose HERO as its unwanted encroachment of government on the daily lives of citizens more than outweighs any potential benefit that the ordinance might bring.
Under HERO, Houstonians can file complaints if they allege that they've been discriminated against. HERO then requires the Houston Inspector General to become involved, and if necessary, open up a criminal case. If a case is filed, it is heard in Houston's municipal court. Small business owners and government agencies stand to be fined $5,000 for every violation of the ordinance. This is a recipe for enhanced government meddling, not to mention the use of local police powers to intimidate and tax citizens and lawful businesses.
Notably, most of the 15 different categories of protected classes in HERO are already federally protected by existing laws and U.S. Supreme Court rulings/precedent. The exceptions, of course, are for gender identity and sexual orientation. This is not inherently bad ‚Äî there is a reason why the Supreme Court has not extended constitutional protections further: because government should be involved in our daily lives to the most limiting extent possible. Should Congress wish to extend constitutional protections to transgender individuals, it can easily do so. Alternatively, the U.S. Supreme Court could take this issue up when properly presented.
Further concerning about HERO is the fact the city of Houston has sought to subvert the will of the voters at every turn. In short, city officials continue to have problems abiding by their city charter. After the referendum was deemed necessary, the Texas Supreme Court had to step in once again, (amid concerns the Mayor of Houston was furthering her political agenda while sidestepping the procedures that are in place to prevent the very same) because the ballot language was unacceptable. The city of Houston's political maneuvering regarding the ballot language is so concerning that state Sen. Paul Bettencourt released a statement calling for the Senate Intergovernmental Affairs Committee to look into the city's ""use of deceptive ballot language and continual erring on election procedure.""
When HERO was first passed by the city council, citizens had organized and petitioned for either a repeal or to have the ordinance put forward to popular vote. On Aug. 4, 2014, the city announced it would not reconsider the ordinance. As the Supreme Court of Texas stated, ""Yet the City Council decided, of its own accord, not to act, disregarding the City Secretary's certification that the petition had enough signatures."" These maneuverings are costing the citizens of Houston considerable time and legal fees given that the Supreme Court of Texas has had to step in three times over the course of the last few months.
Ultimately, the people's right to vote is being protected, and the people of Houston have voiced their preference. Small voter turnout numbers have often been a problem, even with hot-button issues, but the reality is that our democratic process allows for this. For people who feel differently, the only alternative is to get out and vote.
Arnold: Voters misled by imaginary problem
Let's start with a point of agreement. Mr. Moster and I are in accord that ""legislation is sometimes necessary to fight various forms of discrimination. But for some reason, he does not appear to think that preventing discrimination against LGBT people is within that category. Let's examine his reasons for that conclusion.
First, he talks about the ""unwanted encroachment of government on the daily lives of citizens."" What encroachment? If a business doesn't practice discrimination, the law will have no impact on it at all. If it does practice discrimination, it should feel the wrath of government breathing down its neck.
Assume that Bill's delicatessen does not practice discrimination. After John and Mary's wedding they come to Bill's for their post- wedding meal holding hands and are seated. They are followed by George and Sam who have just celebrated their wedding protected by the ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (the same-sex marriage case), and they are also seated by Bill who does not practice discrimination.
Now, assume that the two couples instead go to Joe's Sandwich Shop on the other side of the shopping center. Once more John and Mary are seated, But George and Sam are escorted out of the restaurant by Joe, who angrily says: ""We don't need any fag couples in this restaurant!""
If HERO had passed, Joe would have been fined $5,000 for his outrageous conduct. But with HERO defeated, Joe can get away with this sort of behavior scott free. Frankly, this is an illustration of where ""enhanced government meddling,"" if meddling it must be called is totally appropriate and desirable. And, if HERO had passed, what Joe did would not be part of ""lawful business."" And, if he wants to avoid a $5,000 fine, all he would need to do is adhere to the law in the same way that recalcitrant restaurants were forced to do when racial discrimination became unlawful.
Mr. Moster is quite right that Congress could extend statutory (though not constitutional) protection to the LGBT community by simply amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It does seem strange to me that this would be his preferred method of operation. Traditionally, local choice is thought to be far superior to decisions made in far off Washington. After all, the Houston City Council, for all the flaws that Mr. Moster and the Texas Supreme Court find with its procedures, is still the duly elected representative body of the city of Houston.
Providing a preferred constitutional status for sexual preference is certainly an option for the Supreme Court, indeed one it came close to adopting in Obergefell. But that, along with congressional action, should be a last resort, not a first and preferred resort.
If cities like Houston continue to reject equality it may come to either congressional or judicial imposition of equality on the citizens of Houston. But it should not have to come to that.
When the citizens of Indiana realized that if their Religious Freedom Restoration Act (which appeared to allow discrimination against homosexuals) was causing them to lose convention business and ultimately threatened the Super Bowl, the state needed to retrench. Similarly if major events choose not to come to Houston and mention its lack of an equal rights ordinance as its reason for doing so, I suspect that the good citizens of Houston, like those of Indiana, will quickly rectify the situation.
But none of this should have been necessary. The Houston citizenry should have not have rejected HERO, and perhaps would not have, if they hadn't been misled by the imaginary ""potty problem."" Let us hope when this mistaken understanding is rectified and when City Council procedures are not the issue that a future band of Houston citizens will do the right thing. That is surely better than having the right thing rammed down its throat by the federal government.",Campaign for Houston ,1,2347,74.9,38.82,20.78,38.06,20.06,26.25,84.87,62.93,52.19,9.03,3.41,0.77,0.51,0.04,0.85,0.85,5.62,15.38,8.35,0.89,14.4,9.59,4.3,5.67,1.87,14.44,5.16,2.64,6.69,0.89,0.81,4.99,15.08,0.89,14.06,2.81,1.87,2.73,2.3,0.85,5.03,0,4.64,2.9,1.66,0.72,0.21,0.47,0.09,0.21,0,0.04,11.5,6.18,0.26,0.43,1.36,2.3,0.72,6.95,0.26,0,0.43,1.45,4.47,4.39,0.04,0.04,2.94,0.3,0.21,1.96,0.68,0.17,1.49,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0.3,0,1.07,0.21,0.21,0.09,0.04,0,0.13,0.85,0.13,3.45,7.16,0.47,1.07,5.33,0.34,0.09,0.09,2.22,3.54,4.9,0.89,0.13,0,0.09,0.04,0,14.91,5.37,4.77,0.17,0.04,1.24,3.32,0,0.38,0.17,0.09,0.13,0.13,3.45,4.09,3.39,3.39,2.97,-2.01,-0.39,0,-0.13,-0.77,0.26,0.13,0.21,0.17,1.41,0.6,0.09,0,0.72,0.09,0.3,0.21,1.58,0.13,0.3,0.04,0.09,0,0,0,0.04,0.09,0,0,2.67,1.64,19.14,161.98,1.11,494.46,1.24,196.08,1.66,221.65,1.58,98.04,-0.68,319.69,0.13,289.86,0,85.25,0.13,34.1,0.21,21.31,0,38.36,132.14,123.61,51.15,17.05,63.94,-0.04,183.29,51.15,8.53,80.99,12.79,0.13,4.26,149.19,25.58,319.69,51.15,8.53,8.53,1.19,1,0.47,0.89,0.21,0.04,0,0.13,0.21,0,0.47,0.04,0.04,0.09,1

11/24/15,19,B,HCC trustee to sue college - Wilson seeks reimbursement for legal fees ,"Dave Wilson has long been a thorn in the side of Houston Community College trustees. That hasn't changed now that he's one of them.
Wilson, a controversial figure long before he was elected to the HCC board in 2013, has done nothing to diminish his gadfly reputation in his first two years as a trustee. From a campaign criticized as deceptive and a dispute over whether he lives in the district he represents, to a complaint filed against the college and a legal tussle over his exclusion from an executive session, Wilson's actions have rankled his fellow trustees since he took office in January 2014.
Now Wilson is preparing to sue HCC over roughly $50,000 in legal fees stemming from a lengthy and ongoing dispute over the election that put him on the board.
Before he was even sworn into office, Harris County challenged his election in court, contending that Wilson lied about his residency when he claimed to live in an apartment in his northwest Houston warehouse rather than with his wife in a home outside the district. Some critics said Wilson, who is white, had misled voters in the largely black district into believing he is black - something Wilson hasn't explicitly denied, telling the Chronicle soon after the election that ""politics is guerrilla warfare.""
Before he was elected, Wilson had for years shown up to HCC meetings to speak out against the board's actions. He filed a lawsuit against the college in 2011 when it spent $8.3 million on 22 acres of flood-prone land off Westheimer.
Wilson has also built a reputation as an anti-gay activist, calling on HCC to cancel its plans to sponsor a float in last year's gay pride parade and most recently fighting against the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
Wilson has won several rounds in the court dispute over his residency, which the county is continuing to appeal, saying that the case raises important issues of law.
""We believe that a person should not be able to claim the benefit of a residential homestead at one location while registering to vote at a different location,"" Robert Soard, first assistant county attorney, said in an email. ""More fundamentally, an elected representative should not be allowed to serve and set the tax rate for a district in which he does not personally reside.""
Wilson says HCC should cover his legal fees, but his fellow trustees disagreed. Wilson wasn't able to garner the votes needed to put the item on an agenda after the state attorney general ruled last month that the college would have to prove paying the fees was for a public good.
""Based on the attorney general opinion we've received regarding this request, I don't feel we have the authority to reimburse trustee Wilson from tax dollars,"" board chairman Zeph Capo said in a text message. ""Wilson's legal dispute with the county began prior to beginning his term as a trustee. Given the AG ruling, I'm taking the advice he often gives us in similar circumstances ... Let 'em sue.""
And that's what Wilson plans to do.
""It's going to be soon, it's going to be real soon,"" Wilson said Monday, after failing to get support from the trustees at last Thursday's meeting.
In August, Wilson filed a complaint with the Harris County District Attorney's office alleging the college unlawfully overpaid for a vacant building. The complaint, still pending, focuses on HCC's February purchase of a former Conn's store for $8.5 million, $3.2 million higher than the original value assigned by the same appraiser in November. The higher value reflected a planned five-year lease of the building to Tesla Motors that never materialized; HCC has yet to find a tenant.
When trustees met in executive session soon after the complaint was filed, they wouldn't let Wilson in. He engaged his attorney to challenge this decision, incurring another $1,300 in legal fees he says the college must pay. The board has let him into every executive session since, including a meeting a week later when the board voted to hire a defense attorney for Chancellor Cesar Maldonado.
""It's not me costing the college more, it's them because they're not doing what's right,"" Wilson said.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,698,91.36,52.02,30.63,18.54,24.93,25.07,82.09,60.32,49,9.46,6.02,0.43,0.57,0,4.15,0.72,3.44,16.48,10.6,2.44,16.19,7.02,2.87,4.3,1.72,13.9,4.44,3.87,8.74,2.29,1.58,5.01,8.88,0.43,8.45,1.72,1,1,0.72,0.29,3.72,0,2.72,1.29,1.43,0.29,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,13.04,5.73,0.29,0.29,1.72,0.14,3.01,7.31,0.14,0,0.14,4.15,2.44,2.29,0,0.14,8.45,0,0.86,5.44,2.29,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,0.57,0,0.72,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,2.15,9.03,0.14,0.57,7.31,0.72,0,0.14,6.73,5.16,4.87,2.01,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,16.62,4.73,5.01,0,0,3.44,3.44,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,2.7,3.05,2.72,3.03,2.27,-2.62,-1.11,-1.54,-1.32,-1.99,0.57,1.29,0.14,0.14,0.43,0.14,0.57,0,0.29,0.14,0,0,0.72,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.63,0.56,13.41,143.06,1.43,243.2,1.57,214.59,2,85.84,0.86,42.92,-0.43,286.12,0.72,314.74,0,114.45,0.14,28.61,0.29,57.22,0,71.53,114.45,57.22,14.31,0,57.22,-0.14,71.53,42.92,42.92,28.61,14.31,0.14,0,28.61,14.31,71.53,14.31,0,0,0.86,1,0,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0,1

to vote no against Houston proposition 1
the bathroom ordinance I'm against that
ordinance but not against equal rights I
am for equal rights that's been my whole
life work but at the end of the day I
don't think a man should have access to
a female's restroom under any
circumstances I am a father I've sent my
young daughters into restrooms use the
restroom and I wait outside that door
for them to come out but if I was
standing and I seen a man going in
behind my daughter's I would have a
problem with that that's what I'm asking
citizens to vote no against that hero
proposition one ordinance that gives me
an free access to women's restroom the
spirit of that law is not what we are
intended for equal rights I would say
that you're absolutely confused and you
don't know you're behind from a hole in
the ground as my grandmother used to say
I am a man who has laid civil rights
protests marches for homosexual men who
are the victims of hate crimes even when
some of my own community said you should
not do it I've stood up for the rights
of gay men when they've been victims of
hate crimes but I'm saying on this
ordinance just bathroom or there's this
proposition one I'm voting no and I'm
asking everyone else to vote no because
I'm a father
I sent my daughter's interests rooms
also and if I witness a man going in
behind them I'd have a problem with that
and be extremely uncomfortable with that
I'm asking those who want to see equal
rights for everybody we can do a better
job of passing this law but take the
bathroom ordinance out because no man
should be allowed to go into a woman's
restroom under any circumstances to me
that's not equal rights that's giving
access to those who don't deserve it I
would say to the mayor and her
propaganda tactics see the idea is to
put false propaganda out there to scare
the people and to make us believe the
boogeyman is in the closet when there's
nothing really there she's comparing
apples to Auto chokes men rape every day
in this city in this country
unfortunately but if you allow a man to
go into a woman's restroom with free
access what protections does she have
from that man if he decides to do
something unbutton to the man put
yourself in that woman's place when some

we are looking for a city that has

this metropolitan area but right now
ladies and gentlemen we are in a battle
in my opinion for the soul of this
metropolitan area you say that's
political politics people the Bible is
full of kings and queens and and
governments and ambassadors and
political parties of the pharisees the
sadducees the Rodians the Essenes etc
etcetera the Romans the Greeks and the
body of Christ existed and spoke out on
moral issues throughout the history of
Christianity and that's what I pray we
will do not in a super pious kind of
holier-than-thou position but simply to
say Christian people do not discriminate
we live in a pluralistic society and
people can choose their religion their
faith their lifestyle within the
freedoms that we enjoy as citizens
in this Republic but there comes a point
in which we stand up and simply say in
the beginning God created this earth in
the beginning God created man and woman
and we have in our society facilities
for men and women in restrooms and in
showers that are exclusively for men
here and women here and when this is
blurred out we begin to live as animals
therefore I know and I believe that we
will vote and we will vote and simply
say that those of us who believe that
the chromosomes make up that God has
given us should be exercised and we do
not want to be discriminated against
therefore we pray and we vote as God
does leave us remember that most of

against discrimination but a part of it

11/20/15,19,Letters to the Editor,‚ÄòGood people‚Äô must stand together ,"The American people showed their disgust with the direction that our country is headed, by their voting results on Nov. 3 nationwide. The sanctuary city sheriff in San Francisco was given the boot. A Tea Party governor was elected in Kentucky.
In Houston Texas, the Democratic Party‚Äôs ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù was an serious abuse of government power and allowed men dressed in women‚Äôs clothing to go into women‚Äôs restrooms. If they were prohibited, a person or business could be fined $5,000. That monstrosity was defeated.
Those are some of our victories but then there is the Obama administration demands that an Illinois male student, who identifies as female, should be given unfettered access to girls‚Äô facilities: showers, locker rooms and restrooms. Two other states have lost similar cases to the Obama administration. (From The Washington Post and NY Times.)
Remember, Martin Luther King and many other Christians have and are now being persecuted and jailed. Leftist have again pitted themselves against decency, common sense and Christianity.
Good people are again going to have to stand against destructive unconstitutional ordinances and laws.

11/18/15,19,Dr. Young - When to stand up,C4H,"folks we've gone stark raving crazy in
our culture now we've got to ask some
questions we see Jesus was the fire
against this he was defined against much
of the law that day the religious
rituals of that day and he knew that the
kingdom could not come as long as people
accepted religion or religious OT rather
than truly knowing God and being
obedient to him in life got asked some
questions if we are to be defiant in our
culture how do we know when to be
defiled that's the question how do we
know when to stand up against something
that is wrong in our culture it's when
that which is wrong goes against a basic
biblical principle that's how we know if
there's a biblical principle involved
and we as a church and sixty one percent
of the population of Houston and
probably if all metropolitan area had
voted I would guess it will be 80 + %
stood up and said in a real recent
election a biblical principle is at
stake God created man and woman XY
chromosomes and therefore God has
decided on the gender of everybody who
comes in this earth
male and female created he them and we
see a biblical principle a biblical
principle and we stand on the basis of
that principle first question second
questions what is our motive here
Isabella co-principal we're going to
stand and be defined what is our motive
hopefully prayerfully our motive was to
protect our children to protect our
culture and to protect the unborn
generation as well as a generation that
is now here in a society that is so
confused of what discrimination is what
bigotry is what prejudice is we have to
draw a line between what is sin and what
is not sin what is right in the eyes of
God and what is wrong in the eyes of God
so we have to make sure our motive is
pure now if you think that we have won
the war you are absolutely wrong we have
won a battle but the war against good
and evil the war that would protect our
children and our wives it is not over by
any long shot illustration when I leave
here I'll go speak in Katy Texas by the
way the population of katy texas today
is larger than a population of
Pittsburgh Pennsylvania if you know that
oh yeah so I'll go and speak in katy
when i leave this place and just I think
this'll past week there's a day care
center in Katy Texas and a child was
there a young girl 6 years old she's
been brought up by two men who will
together as their daughter she was
brought to school this past week and the
two men had cut her hair dressed her as
a boy and said I've changed her name and
now she she was given a boy's name and
the teachers were asked and the school
was asked to treat her now as a male
because she made the decision at six
that she did not want to be a girl she
wanted to be a boy a teacher in that
school said I'm not going to do it I'm
not going to do it she stood in the
basis of religious liberty and they
along with another teacher were
dismissed by the school this is society
in which we live and you see this at
Illinois you see it everywhere there is
some how the belief that your gender is
fluid we can decide what gender we'd
like to be this is deadly in our society
you've heard me say before I if if Larry
and I were brought up together as young
guys we pal around together even though
he's much older than I am and we became
friends and buddies and I'd put my arm
around him he put his arm around me and
I'd say Larry do you like girls oh I
hate girls I hate girls too and we would
go up five six seven eight years ago in
this crazy culture there'll be people
who would say you know Edwin in Larry
are probably homosexuals because they
don't like girls right that's what'll
happen to us that's how the identity
will be made so ladies and gentlemen we
have to lovingly
kindly gently deal with something we
don't like to deal with I don't like it
you don't like it it's for y'all
anything I ever imagined I'd have to
deal with but sometimes silence is
golden right but sometimes silence is
sin and if we stand up silent will see a
culture and world that will be exactly
like you find it in Romans chapter one
as Paul was writing to church at Rome
you say well other other cities other
nations haven't dealt with this it goes
all over back to Rome and look what Paul
says in the word about a same situation
Romans 1 verse 22 professing to be wise
and we heard that they became fools and
they exchanged the glory of the
incorruptible God for an image in the
form of corruptible man and birds and
four-footed animals and called in queen
other words they no longer worship the
true and holy and pure god they worship
other stuff oh they believe there's a
god but their worship was not there they
had all the form but not the power
profession to be wise they became fools
verse 24 therefore God gave them over to
the lust of their hearts to impurity so
that their bodies would be dishonored
among them for they exchanged the truth
of God for a lie and worshipped and
served the creature rather than the
Creator who is blessed forever for this
reason God gave up on him God gave them
over to degrading passions listen for
their women exchanged a natural function
for that which is unnatural and the same
way also the men abandoned the natural
function of the woman and burned in
8:29
their desire for one another men with
men
meaning indecent acts and receiving and
their own persons the due penalty of the
era the health factor is overwhelming
verse 23 and just as they did not see
fit to acknowledge God to acknowledge
God any longer God gave up on them gave
them over to a depraved reprobate mind
to do those things which are not proper
being filled with all unrighteousness
wickedness greed evil full of envy
murder strife deceit malice their gossip
so slanderers haters of God insolvent
arrogant boastful inventors of evil
disobedient to parents without
understanding untrustworthy unloop
unloving unmerciful and although they
knew they knew the ordinance of God that
those who practice such things are
worthy of death and also give hearty
hearty hearty approval they applaud
those who live these lifestyles ladies
and gentlemen that's exactly where a lot
of our culture finds itself today and as
men and women of God in Christ we will
have to be own too many occasions loving
but defiant defiant as Jesus stood we're
gonna have to stand now
people said boy this was a great victory
for the church we had the church didn't
stand up ladies and gentlemen I could
name denominations denominations
denominations that I mentioned I didn't
see a single one of many denominations
stand up and say I believe the Bible and
this is wrong they didn't show up as far
as any public / mountain of whose side
they were on because we sold out
basically even in the body of Christ if
we cannot stand on this moral issue if
the church is just to be formed without
power tell me what on earth the church
the body of Christ should stand on that
is what we face he has sounded forth the
trumpet that shall never call retreat he
has sifted out the hearts of men before
his judgment seat Oh be swift my soul to
answer him be Jubal on my feet our God
is marching on

11/17/15,19,B,Parker won't revisit HERO ,"Mayor Annise Parker said Monday she will not attempt to revive the controversial equal rights ordinance that voters resoundingly rejected this month.
Speculation had abounded since Parker, in the days after the sweeping defeat, said the City Council might revisit the ordinance before she leaves office at the end of the year. Though she was limited by time and the fact that several council members are in the midst of tight runoff races, foes seized on that statement. They began making calls warning residents that the law could return.
In a written statement, Parker said, ""Considering all the other issues I still want to get finished, I do not see a way that we will be able to revisit the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance before I leave office at the end of the year.""
The nondiscrimination law the council approved last year offered protections for 15 classes, including gay and transgender residents, the flash point for opponents of the law.

11/17/15,19,B,Parker won't revisit HERO ,"Mayor Annise Parker said Monday she will not attempt to revive the controversial equal rights ordinance that voters resoundingly rejected this month.
Speculation had abounded since Parker, in the days after the sweeping defeat, said the City Council might revisit the ordinance before she leaves office at the end of the year. Though she was limited by time and the fact that several council members are in the midst of tight runoff races, foes seized on that statement. They began making calls warning residents that the law could return.
In a written statement, Parker said, ""Considering all the other issues I still want to get finished, I do not see a way that we will be able to revisit the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance before I leave office at the end of the year.""
The nondiscrimination law the council approved last year offered protections for 15 classes, including gay and transgender residents, the flash point for opponents of the law.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing and city contracting faced up to $5,000 in fines for violations. Religious institutions were exempt.
After more than a year of legal wrangling, the law went to voters, who rejected it 61 percent to 39 percent.

11/16/15,19,NA,New battle looms over anti-bias ordinance First of 3 meetings Tuesday offer forum for debate over LGBT issue ,"Minutes after Jacksonville City Council voted down expanding the city's anti-discrimination law to cover lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, attorney Jimmy Midyette huddled outside City Hall with other crestfallen supporters of the failed legislation.
""We'll figure out how we went wrong and what we can do better,"" Midyette said on that August night in 2012. ""I guarantee you this - we are not done fighting for LGBT rights.""
First Baptist Church had its own response to the outcome.
At a Sunday service, the congregation gave a standing ovation to seven City Council members who came to be thanked for standing ""in the gap"" and opposing the bill.
Three years after the raw emotion during the City Council's 10-9 vote against the measure, the question is back again as Mayor Lenny Curry begins a series of ""community conversations"" aimed at exploring the issue from various perspectives.
As Curry hears different viewpoints at those meetings, supporters and opponents of expanding the city's anti-discrimination law will vie to win him over to their side. Supporters of the change are hoping Curry will embrace an all-inclusive approach that covers not only sexual orientation but also gender identity and expression, which applies to transgender people.
People against changing the law want Curry to take a strong stance by pledging to veto any legislation that comes out of the council.
The first session in the ""community conversations"" convened by Curry will be at 6 p.m. Tuesday at Florida State College at Jacksonville's Downtown Campus, followed by another Dec. 3 at Edward Waters College and a third meeting Dec. 15 at Jacksonville University.
Curry has said he rejects discrimination ""in any form"" but he has not said whether he would support expanding Jacksonville's human rights ordinance - which bans discrimination in the areas of housing, employment and public accommodations - to include LGBT people.
During the campaign for mayor in the spring, Curry said he saw no need for Jacksonville to alter the ordinance.
""I remain unconvinced that we need to change city law on this issue,"" he said at a televised debate in May. ""I've also said that I will lead a public conversation on any serious issue that we have in the city of Jacksonville.""
NEWCOMERS WILL DECIDE
The upcoming meetings will involve panel discussions followed by questions and comments from the audience. The identity of the panelists is a bit of a mystery. Marsha Oliver, spokeswoman for Curry, said Friday the panelists had not been finalized.
Turnover at City Hall since 2012 means the newcomers elected in the spring elections will be the decisive votes this time. Curry defeated Alvin Brown, who never took a stand on this issue.
Eight City Council members who cast votes in 2012 are still at City Hall. Council members Greg Anderson, Lori Boyer, John Crescimbeni and Jim Love voted for the legislation three years ago. Council members Matt Schellenberg, Reggie Brown, Doyle Carter and Bill Gulliford opposed the measure. Raymond Johnson, president of Biblical Concepts Ministries, said based on positions taken by City Council candidates in the spring election, he thinks a majority of the council will expand the human rights ordinance, so he wants Curry to veto any legislation passed by the council.
""The HRO was passed in the May election, period,"" Johnson said. ""It was a done deal. Many people falsely celebrated a Republican victory with the City Council in the spring. Unfortunately, we have elected the most pro-homosexual City Council in our city's history, and it's unacceptable.""
A simple majority - 10 of 19 council members - is needed to pass legislation. Overriding a mayor's veto requires a super-majority vote, which would be at least 13 council members.
Johnson said he's concerned Curry will use the upcoming meetings ""as an excuse to not veto the HRO.""
""If he would veto the law, we would support him 100 percent and praise him from the rooftops,"" Johnson said. ""If he does not veto it, he will reap the consequences.""
Supporters of expanding the city's anti-discrimination law hope Curry will side with updating the ordinance.
Midyette, who is part of the Jacksonville Coalition for Equality, said a major difference from 2012 is that this time, Curry and City Council members take up the issue after it was ""front and center"" on the campaign trail.
""It was one of the issues people talked about along with the pension liability and business development,"" he said. ""It just became an important part of the electoral conversation, so having a mayor elected who made it part of his campaign to say he would lead on this issue, and who is doing so now, gives me a lot of hope for our effort this time.""
RAPID CHANGES
The second round of debate over the human rights ordinance will play out against a backdrop of rapid changes that have taken place nationally in the sphere of LGBT rights.
Since 2012, same-sex marriage has become the law of the land because of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling. The Boy Scouts of America dropped its ban on gay Scouts and modified its prohibition against gay Scout leaders.
At the municipal level, cities across the country have added more protections for LGBT people, according to annual scorecards by the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for such laws. The city of Atlantic Beach passed a human rights ordinance in August 2014.
And there has been some backlash. This month, a voter referendum in Houston struck down anti-discrimination laws enacted in 2014. Opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance used ""No Men in Women's Bathrooms"" signs to urge rejection, arguing the law would allow men dressed as women to go into women's bathrooms.
Jacksonville's human rights ordinance bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, marital status, age and disability.
In 2012, the City Council originally considered a bill that would have expanded the law to cover people regardless of ""sexual orientation, gender identity or expression."" The language about gender identity and expression applies to people who are transgender.
After opposition surfaced to including ""gender identity or expression,"" a substitute version of the bill dropped that language and would have only added sexual orientation to the ordinance.
That version of the bill met defeat on a 10-9 vote. The City Council then took up the original version with gender identity or expression back in the mix. That version got rejected on a 17-2 vote. City Councilman Tommy Hazouri said Jacksonville needs to include gender identity and expression along with sexual orientation in the human rights ordinance. He said he hopes Curry will recommend an ""all-inclusive ordinance"" after hearing from people at the upcoming meetings.
Hazouri said other large Florida cities already have such laws on the books.
""Short of that, it would not just be a big disappointment for Jacksonville,"" Hazouri said. ""It would be a disappointment for those continuing to be left behind.""
The Duval County Democratic Party will highlight its support for an all-inclusive ordinance when Houston Mayor Annise Parker is the keynote speaker at a Nov. 30 dinner event for the local party organization. Parker supported the ordinance that Houston's City Council enacted in 2014.
Duval County Democratic Party Chairman Neil Henrichsen said he thinks the campaign against Houston's ordinance was ""based on inaccurate propaganda that was meant to be fear-mongering and it was successful,"" he said. ""I think in Jacksonville that can be avoided by being very clear on what changing the ordinance will accomplish - that it's protecting the rights of people in the community.""
But opponents of expanding the human rights ordinance are pointing to Houston as a reason against a change in Jacksonville.
""I believe you to be a Christian based on your campaign communication,"" First Conservative Baptist Church Pastor Gene Youngblood wrote in a letter to Curry. ""Therefore I know that you do realize the far-reaching impact for the future of our great city if Jacksonville passes an HRO, as was the case in Houston, Texas.""
The three meetings convened by Curry will go through December, so any deliberation by the council on HRO legislation would not begin until 2016.

11/16/15,19,B,LETTERS ,"Honoring vets
Regarding ""Paying respects on Veterans Day"" (Page B1, Thursday), I was among the honorees at the Spring Forest Middle School Veterans Day celebration. My wife and I were shown where to park and escorted in to a scrumptious breakfast prepared by the PTA. Then, the veterans were led into the gymnasium, where we were seated in the middle of the gym.
The students - sixth, seventh and eighth-graders - were in the bleachers and dressed in red, white and blue. They ran the program, introduced the speakers, etc. The students were unbelievable, wanting to shake our hands, telling us ""Thank you for serving"" and more.
Spring Forest Middle School has been doing this since 9/11. It is great to see young Americans showing such appreciation for veterans.
Charlie Eskridge, Houston Rail sense
Regarding ""Planned high-speed rail line won't come downtown"" (HoustonChronicle.com, Thursday), I moved to Houston in 1984 to go to grad school, and rail was being debated then.
Fast forward 30 years to 2015, and we don't even have our two airports hooked up to rail yet!
Our priority should be rail connectivity to Hobby and Intercontinental instead of high-speed rail to Dallas. I know which train I would most likely use, and I would guess that most Houstonians would feel the same way.
Many of us make trips to the airport, dropping people off, picking people up and parking and then flying out ourselves. The absurdity of leaving these two airports disconnected from the rail system all this time is hard for me to understand.
Gregg Gebetsberger, posted on HoustonChronicle.com ISIS threat
Regarding ""Terror in Paris"" (Page A1, Saturday), as we mourn the victims of the horrific attacks in Paris, let us pause a moment to think about our current debate on immigration.
Given the security challenges we face, how can we justify the huge amount of resources that would be required to arrest and remove millions of hard-working residents from this country?
We need to focus our resources on ISIS. For the safety of our country, we need to move beyond campaign sound bites to a thoughtful policy on immigration. Let us come together and protect, rather than divide, our country.
Katherine L. Butler, Houston Wedge issues Regarding ""Taking sides on HERO battlefront"" (Page B9, Friday), I know well-meaning people on both sides of the defeated Houston equal rights ordinance issue. However, I believe the runoff election will highlight the major ulterior motive behind this ordinance and that is to act as a wedge issue.
The intention is to make people one-issue voters and, in some cases, vote against their own best interests on other issues and candidates. The future will show that if HERO can be dragged out through 2016, it will join its other wedge-issue brethren Planned Parenthood and Benghazi in the presidential elections.
Ron Curtis, Houston Cougar pride

American victories
The American people showed their disgust with the direction that our country is headed by their voting results on Nov. 3. The sanctuary city sheriff in San Francisco was given the boot.
A tea party governor was elected in Kentucky.
In Houston, the Democratic Party's ""bathroom ordinance"" was a serious abuse of government power and allowed men dressed in women's clothing to go into women's restrooms. If they were prohibited, a person or business could be fined $5,000. That monstrosity was defeated.
Those are some of our victories. But, then there is the Obama administration demands that an Illinois male student, who identifies as female, should be given unfettered access to girls' facilities: showers, locker rooms and restrooms. Two other states have lost similar cases to the Obama administration (The Washington Post and The New York Times).
A few share a view similar to Belinda Tupper, who said, ""Kim Davis is a disgrace. Especially considering the fact that she proclaims herself to be a Christian woman. She was cited with contempt, jailed and is now back to work."" (DRC online Sept. 13)
Ms. Tupper should remember Martin Luther King and many other Christians have been jailed and some are now being persecuted and jailed.
Leftists have again pitted themselves against decency, commonsense and Christianity.
Good people are again going to have to stand against destructive unconstitutional ordinances and laws.

11/13/15,19,Letters to the Editor,Patrick and prejudice ,"e: ‚ÄúPatrick assails LGBT vote ‚Äî He and GOP senator raise bathroom issue; Rawlings defends rights measure,‚Äù Thursday news story.
If anyone needed proof the majority of voters in most elections don‚Äôt know what is on the ballot until they read it in the voting booth and then vote the way an advertisement told them to, it isn‚Äôt our Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.
On Tuesday, the City Council voted unanimously to specify that Dallas‚Äô anti-discrimination ordinance applies to both ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender orientation‚Äù in the Dallas ordinance that has prohibited discrimination in employment, public accommodations and housing.
On Thursday, The Dallas Morning News reported that Patrick released a statement saying the ordinance is ‚Äúto allow men in women‚Äôs bathrooms,‚Äù which, according to The News, is ‚Äúechoing his opposition to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which was defeated last week.‚Äù
Ah, our lieutenant governor seems to love the smell of the Political Power of Prejudice (PPP) in the morning. Willa Kulhavy, Garland
Restroom cop
Texas Lt. Gov. and EBM (Executive Bathroom Monitor) Dan Patrick has taken issue with a 2014 charter amendment that provides additional protections for city employees, specifically against discrimination in employment, housing, etc. As the state‚Äôs self- appointed restroom cop, Patrick feels this will lead to a mass pilgrimage of men to use the ladies‚Äô room, which, of course, is well known as a recruitment station for the LGBT community.
Here in Dallas, we‚Äôre used to a certain amount of silliness from our red state leaders in order to keep their way-far-right constituency happy. I mean, why allow a multibillion-dollar revenue generator like casino gambling when the state‚Äôs getting hammered by low oil prices?
We‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs the price you pay to live in the state with the best barbecue in the civilized world. But, lieutenant governor, if you really think one of the perks of being transgendered is the ability to use a private stall in a ladies‚Äô room, well, I guess I‚Äôll just have to suffer through the anguish of remaining straight. And you‚Äôll forgive us if we have bigger fish to fry.

11/13/15,19,Editorial / Columnists,Rangel: Next legislative session shaping up as heated ,"AUSTIN ‚Äî The start of the 85th Texas Legislature is more than a year away but there are already signs the 2017 session could be one of the most polemical since Republicans gained control of all branches of the state government 13 years ago.
Last month, for example, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick issued his interim charges ‚Äî issues the lawmakers take an in-depth look at before they are back in session ‚Äî loaded with hot button issues such as school vouchers, religious liberty, banning the so-called sanctuary cities and even reviewing the right of public employees to have union dues deducted from their paychecks.
Two weeks later it was Gov. Greg Abbott's turn to grab the headlines.
Abbott warned Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez her department's policy of dealing with undocumented immigrants who commit crimes ""will no longer be tolerated in Texas.""
The Legislature ""must pass laws that prohibit any policy or action like yours that promotes sanctuary to people in this state illegally,"" Abbott said.
In addition, with their vocal opposition to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance that Houston voters overwhelmingly rejected on Nov. 3, Abbott and Patrick signaled the state's opposition to gay rights is not over, even if the U.S. Supreme Court has legalized same- sex marriage.
On the flip side, the Texas Democratic Party is calling on supporters of President Barack Obama's executive order to halt the deportation of an estimated 5 million undocumented immigrants to join next Saturday's ""Rally for Immigrant Families"" in front of the Governor's Mansion.
""These programs sought to bring temporary relief for millions of immigrant families, bringing them out of the shadows, lifting the fear of deportation, and allowing them to give back to this great country of ours,"" chairman Gilberto Hinojosa wrote in an email to the party faithful.
""We cannot let Republicans get away with this attack on our communities,"" Hinojosa said after noting that ‚Äî in his last days as Texas Attorney General ‚Äî Abbott sued the Obama administration.
To the dismay of party officials and immigrant rights advocates, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals recently agreed with a lower court ruling that blocked Obama's executive order.
The rally has the potential of drawing hundreds of protesters from across the state ‚Äîas it happened in the spring when the Senate considered the sanctuary cities bill Lubbock Republican Sen. Charles Perry authored ‚Äî because the Texas AFL-CIO has endorsed the protest.
""Gov. Abbott has taken an anti-reform position that is tearing families apart,"" Texas AFL-CIO President John Patrick said in a statement.
""In solidarity with immigrant working people, we are asking the governor to meet with families affected by current immigration policies and to reverse course for the benefit of our state,"" Patrick said.
Some Democratic legislators have also made it clear though they will likely be outnumbered again, they will oppose Abbott and the Republican majority in the Legislature when illegal immigration, gay rights and other divisive bills are considered. ""Gov. Abbott appears to be vying for the title of the most anti-Hispanic governor in the history of Texas,"" Rep. Rafael Anchia of Dallas said after Abbott called for sanctuary cities legislation.
""As attorney general he sued the federal government over President Obama's immigration executive actions, specifically the implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and Deferred Action for Parental Accountability programs,"" Anchia said. ""Governor Abbott will soon be known as the Donald Trump of Texas if he continues his ill-advised pursuit of anti-Hispanic policies.""
In the end, the success of the legislation Abbott and Lt. Gov. Patrick intend to pursue may depend on the make-up of the House of Representatives.
For instance, though the House State Affairs Committee has scheduled a sanctuary cities hearing on Dec. 10, there is no guarantee such legislation can pass in the lower chamber if Speaker Joe Straus and some of his top lieutenants defeat their respective challengers in the March 1 Republican primary.

11/12/15,19,City Hall,"On Glenn Beck's Blaze, Philip Kingston tries to correct 'crazy' surrounding Dallas' anti-bias laws ","‚ÄúYour bathroom experience will not change.‚Äù Here we go ... again.
One day after the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to amend a 13-year-old ordinance that already protected the LGBT community from discrimination, council member Philip Kingston went on Glenn Beck‚Äôs website The Blaze to explain that, no, this isn‚Äôt a bathroom ordinance because there‚Äôs no such thing as a bathroom ordinance. There‚Äôs an anti-discrimination ordinance that‚Äôs been on the books since 2002. And there‚Äôs a charter amendment voters overwhelmingly approved by 77 percent in 2014. But despite what they say down in Houston, there‚Äôs no such thing as a bathroom ordinance.
The host of the show is Dana Loesch, author of the book Hands Off My Gun: Defeating the Plot to Disarm America. The other guest is ‚Äúanti-gay crusader‚Äù Jonathan Saenz, president of Texas Values.
No need to recap the background behind the exchange; certainly you‚Äôre up to speed by now and aware that, according to city officials, since 2002 there‚Äôs never been a single complaint filed involving a transgender individual and a bathroom of any kind. It‚Äôs not much of a debate: We miss Loesch‚Äôs set-up for the segment, but do get Kingston‚Äôs polite dismissal of it (‚ÄúAlmost nothing you said in the intro was right ‚Äî I don‚Äôt mean to be argumentative‚Äù). Kingston then explains what happened Tuesday, after which Loesch hands over the mic to Saenz, who insists, among other things, that this 13-year-old law was written behind closed doors on Monday and OK‚Äôd on Tuesday and that ‚Äúthis type of Dallas bathroom ordinance, just like the one in Houston, threatens the safety of women and children.‚Äù
Kingston ‚Äî sporting a ‚ÄúDallas is Great‚Äù tie ‚Äî isn‚Äôt having it.
To sum up his response to Saenz: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just flat false. That‚Äôs a lie. You‚Äôre just making stuff up at this point. Also false. That‚Äôs like 100 percent made-up. That‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù

11/12/15,19,State,Backlash not yet evident after defeated Houston HERO vote ,"
Just hours after it became clear that Houston's non-discrimination ordinance, HERO, would be trounced at the polls last week, Houston Mayor Annise Parker predicted a ""direct, economic backlash"" for the city, akin to criticism and boycott threats in Arizona and Indiana after similar controversies.
But so far, any visible backlash has yet to materialize, and Houston appears at no risk of losing two upcoming major sporting events.
Tagged by opponents as ""the bathroom ordinance,"" HERO would have made it illegal to discriminate against someone based on 15 ""protected characteristics"" ‚Äî including sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents' ad campaigns targeted ""gender identity"" in particular and featured ominous, hulking men stalking little girls into bathroom stalls. That tactic proved largely successful, and the ordinance was defeated by about 61 percent of voters.
In the days after the vote, a petition asking National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell to revoke Houston's status as host for the 2017 Super Bowl garnered about 3,500 signatures, and Chad Griffin, president of the national Human Rights Campaign, wrote Goodell seeking an ""emergency meeting"" to discuss pulling out.
But the NFL said its plans aren't going to change.
""We will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events,"" a statement released by the NFL said. ""Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness.""
Similarly, the National Collegiate Athletic Association said it will proceed with plans to hold the Final Four portion of next year's March Madness basketball tournament in Houston. However, Dan Gavitt, vice president of men's basketball championships, conceded that the HERO vote ""could impact the NCAA returning to Houston"" in the future.
HERO opponents dismissed concerns of economic backlash from the beginning. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick went one step further, telling The New York Times that even if HERO's defeat did come at a cost, it would be worth it. If organizations like the NFL ""would even suggest that the Super Bowl not be played here because we don't want men in ladies' bathrooms, then we need a new commissioner,"" he said.
If anything, the ordinance's defeat has invigorated Patrick and other opponents of non-discrimination measures that include sexual orientation and gender identity.
On Wednesday, Patrick criticized the Dallas City Council for reaffirming a similar ordinance that the city has had in place for more than a decade.
The response to Houston's vote, relatively quiet outside the LGBT advocacy community, stands in contrast to larger controversies sparked by similar bills in recent years.
Before Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a version of the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act last year, several major companies ‚Äî including the NFL, Delta Air Lines, and Major League Baseball ‚Äî issued statements of concern, and many groups threatened boycotts. The bill would have allowed businesses to deny service to gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.
Indiana faced a similar backlash earlier this year, when Gov. Mike Pence signed a version of the same bill. The NCAA described itself as ""especially concerned,"" executives at Apple, PayPal and Yelp expressed opposition, and at least one convention threatened to relocate. HERO advocates say they aren't sure why the latest developments in Houston aren't attracting as much attention.
Jessica Shortall, managing director of Texas Competes ‚Äî a coalition of businesses that lobbies for pro-LGBT policies they say will keep Texas economically competitive ‚Äî said it's hard to know what, if any, backlash there will be. ""It's impossible to predict to what extent the business community will react to what has happened in Houston,"" Shortall said.Still, she said, cities can take economic hits in many forms ‚Äî some more subtle than boycotts.""On a broader scale, there's a talent issue to think about,"" Shortall said. ""Especially when we're looking at millennials, the brand of a place is something that people who care about attracting talent to a state or region think about.""Shortall cited Fort Worth as an example ‚Äî earlier this year, city officials told the Fort Worth Star- Telegram that Facebook examined the city's non-discrimination ordinance, similar in language to HERO, before announcing it would build a new $1 billion data center.The effect of a given policy ‚Äî or lack thereof, in HERO's case ‚Äî isn't always quantifiable, she said.""It's the cumulative effect of many individual decisions,"" Shortall said.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,710,90.46,45.88,24.77,25.7,24.48,31.41,77.46,55.63,40.7,5.77,1.69,0,0.85,0,0.42,0.28,4.08,12.68,7.89,1.41,13.66,4.93,3.38,5.77,0.99,11.55,7.32,4.23,6.34,1.83,1.27,3.52,11.69,0.28,11.27,1.69,1.69,1.69,2.54,0.14,4.37,0,5.07,2.68,2.25,0.42,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,12.11,7.32,0.28,0.28,1.69,1.41,2.96,5.49,0,0,0.7,0.85,1.97,1.97,0,0,6.2,2.39,0,1.97,2.11,0.28,0.85,0.14,0,0.14,0,0,0.7,0,0,0.28,0.14,0.14,0.14,0,0,0.14,0.85,0.14,3.1,7.18,0.7,0.7,5.21,0.42,0.14,0.28,4.51,3.38,2.25,2.11,0,0,0,0,0,19.86,4.79,7.18,0,0,3.1,4.79,0,0.28,0,0,0,0,3.3,3.55,3.38,3.35,2.7,-2.89,-1.05,-0.28,-0.33,-1.53,0.56,0.42,0.14,0.42,0.14,0.14,0.85,0,0.56,0.14,0.28,0.28,0.56,0.28,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.9,1.3,16.38,140.85,0.99,295.77,0.99,239.44,2.25,309.86,1.97,42.25,-0.42,281.69,-0.28,225.35,0,112.68,-0.14,42.25,0.42,0,0,28.17,126.76,169.01,14.08,14.08,112.68,0.28,84.51,154.93,0,0,0,0,0,84.51,0,183.1,28.17,28.17,14.08,1.27,1,0.28,0.97,0,0,0,0,0.28,0,0,0.14,0,0,1
11/11/15,19,City Hall,Mayor to Dan Patrick: Dallas' LGBT protections are not 'about where people relieve themselves' ,"
The same people who helped kill Houston‚Äôs Equal Rights Ordinance last week just discovered Dallas has had one on the books for 13 years. And they are not happy about that at all.
On Tuesday the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to fine-tune some language in a long-standing anti-bias ordinance to distinguish between ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression,‚Äù two things initially grouped together in the definition of ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù when Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code was approved in 2002. The city‚Äôs LGBT Task Force worked on the amendment for a year ‚Äî ever since Dallas voters overwhelmingly passed a charter amendment in November 2014 that added both ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù to the list of protections for city employees.
The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment, public accommodations and housing.
But in a statement released this morning ‚Äî one that bore the headline ‚ÄúPatrick Statement on Dallas Bathroom Ordinance‚Äù ‚Äî Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick yet again insists the ordinance is intended ‚Äúto allow men in women‚Äôs restrooms,‚Äù echoing his opposition to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which was defeated last week. He joins state Sen. Don Huffines, a Dallas Republican, in calling for its repeal.
‚ÄúI was very proud to help lead the recent effort where an overwhelming majority of voters in Houston successfully voted down the misnamed and misguided HERO ordinance,‚Äù says Patrick‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why yesterday‚Äôs decision by the Dallas City Council, in closed session, to fast-track the enactment of a similar ordinance to allow men in women‚Äôs restrooms is both mind-boggling and appalling.‚Äù
The vote was conducted in open session ‚Äî because the council cannot take votes behind closed doors. And after it passed, 15-0, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said that Dallas is ‚Äúvery diverse, and we want to make sure everyone is protected.‚Äù
In a statement offered as a response to Patrick‚Äôs, Rawlings said Wednesday afternoon that ‚Äúour job as City Council members is to represent the citizens of Dallas. While we respect others‚Äô points of view, our goal is to protect all of our citizens, including minority groups.‚Äù
Said Rawlings, ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs unanimous City Council vote did not change the scope of our 13-year-old anti-discrimination ordinance. We took action that is consistent with what our voters approved last year and the protections already afforded to our employees. It is not forthright or honest to minimize this issue to a question about where people relieve themselves.‚Äù
As the Texas Tribune points out today, Dallas is one of several Texas cities with laws on the books intended to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees and residents. Also on the list: Fort Worth, Arlington, Austin, Plano, San Antonio, El Paso, Waco and Brownsville.
‚ÄúThe Lieutenant Governor is infamous for fomenting mob mentality against the interests of minorities,‚Äù says Dallas City Council member Philip Kingston via email. ‚ÄúIn Dallas we believe in equal protection under law.‚Äù
Says Dallas City Council member Adam Medrano, chair of the city‚Äôs LGBT Task Force, Patrick and Huffines are dispensing the same ‚Äúmisinformation that killed the HERO ordinance in Houston. It‚Äôs made up of non-truths. This is not a bathroom ordinance. This is about making sure everyone in the city of Dallas is treated equally.‚Äù
Not so long ago the gay community was furious with Rawlings after he refused to bring a marriage equality vote to the city council, proclaiming it a non-issue over which the council had no control. But in the last 18 months, following a low score on the Human Rights Campaign Municipal Equality Index, the council revised the city‚Äôs Family Medical Leave Ordinance to include a ‚Äúdesignated care recipient,‚Äù and extended pension benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian police officers and firefighters. The city also updated its health-care plan to cover some transgender services.
Medrano says amending Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code was just the ‚Äúlast piece‚Äù of the task force‚Äôs recent work. But to the lieutenant governor, it‚Äôs the final straw.
‚ÄúThis ordinance isn‚Äôt about discrimination, it‚Äôs about political correctness ‚Äî and Dallas city leaders have put political correctness ahead of both common sense and common decency,‚Äù says Patrick‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúThe facts are clear. No woman wants a man to be allowed in a ladies restroom or locker room, no matter the reason. And no man wants his wife, daughter, mother, or sister to be forced by law to contend with such an uncomfortable, disruptive, and potentially dangerous intrusion. This ludicrous ordinance, like the one in Houston, reveals officials who are totally out of touch with Texas values.‚Äù
Medrano says the city is taking steps to ‚Äúput the truth out there‚Äù concerning yesterday‚Äôs council action, including reaching out to local legislators. Council members are posting to social media, and Medrano says the city will issue a statement later today. But in the meantime, one of the state‚Äôs most powerful legislators is calling for its repeal.
Yesterday, following the vote, Huffines took to Twitter to attack ‚ÄúDallas‚Äô new sneak-attack LGBT ordinance,‚Äù and said the council had engaged in ‚ÄúObama & Pelosi style sneak-attack governance.‚Äù Kingston told him, via Twitter, to ‚Äústop lying.‚Äù Shortly after that exchange, Huffines launched an online petition intended to ‚ÄúKeep Men Out Of Women‚Äôs Restrooms!‚Äù
Today, says Kingston via email, ‚ÄúThe Lieutenant Governor should try to know something before he shoots his mouth off.‚Äù
Says Patrick in his prepared statement, ‚ÄúI have no doubt that if this issue is put to the voters, as opposed to being decided without adequate public notice and discussion, the people of Dallas ‚Äî like those in Houston ‚Äî will give it a resounding no.‚Äù
But as Kingston and Medrano point out, the issue was put to the voters last November. ‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù says Medrano, ‚Äúit passed with 77 percent of the vote.‚Äù

Here is the original Dallas Morning News story that ran on May 9, 2002, about the initial passage of Dallas‚Äô anti-discrimination ordinance.
Ordinance protecting gays OK‚Äôd
Discrimination ban in Dallas includes housing, employment
By COLLEEN McCAIN NELSON/Staff Writer
Dallas City Council members approved an ordinance Wednesday aimed at protecting gays and lesbians, saying that the anti- discrimination measure was long overdue.
The council voted, 13-2, to adopt the ordinance, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment and such public places as hotels and restaurants. Violations would be punishable by fines of $200 to $500.
Dallas becomes one of several dozen U.S. cities that have prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. Fort Worth, Houston and Austin have approved similar measures. Prominent business executives, including American Airlines chairman and chief executive officer Donald J. Carty, and a Methodist minister were among the few dozen people who expressed support for the ordinance. Two people spoke against it.
Mr. Carty, who spoke of the success of American‚Äôs anti-discrimination policies, told the council that passing the ordinance is a good business decision. ‚ÄúUltimately, the issue transcends self-interest to something more important,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTaking a stand against discrimination ‚Äî whether based on race, gender, religion, class, sexual orientation or anything else ‚Äî is not politically correct. It is simply correct.‚Äù
On the mayoral campaign trail, Laura Miller promised to make enacting the ordinance a top priority. Ms. Miller and council members John Loza, Veletta Forsythe Lill, Ed Oakley and Elba Garcia worked with gay and lesbian leaders to draft the proposal.
Mr. Loza told his colleagues that their decision reaffirmed the worth of every Dallas resident.
‚ÄúI have always been proud of Dallas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs a gay man, today I am especially proud of my city.‚Äù
Mr. Oakley, who is also gay, said the ordinance simply ensured that all people are treated fairly.
‚ÄúIf you think ... that we‚Äôre trying to give special rights to individuals, that is not the case,‚Äù he said.
Council members Alan Walne and Mitchell Rasansky voted against the measure, saying it would cost too much to enforce and would pose an added burden for small-business owners.
Employers with more than 15 workers must comply. Religious organizations and state and federal offices will be exempt. Substantiated complaints will be sent to mediation. Those that remain unresolved will go to the city attorney.
Mr. Walne said he could not justify the expense of enforcing the ordinance when the city is facing a significant budget shortfall.
Two full-time staff members will be assigned to investigate complaints, and a city attorney will work part time on enforcement. The annual cost of salaries and equipment will be about $169,000. The city staff said employees will be reassigned to enforce the ordinance, bringing the cost of the policy down to $15,000.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just making a statement; we‚Äôre adding a cost,‚Äù Mr. Walne said.
Clint Freeman, who urged the council to reject the ordinance, said the proposal would regulate or even outlaw beliefs that homosexuality is wrong.
‚ÄúContrary to the implications of the ordinance, there seems to be no evidence of a problem,‚Äù he said.
But Hector Garcia, former chairman of the city‚Äôs Plan Commission and a Texas Human Rights Foundation board member, told the council that discrimination and bigotry are evident in Texas.
‚ÄúRegardless of how you personally feel about gays, lesbians, the transgendered and bisexuals, know that we are your constituents,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe ... deserve the same protections afforded everyone else.‚Äù",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1533,89.16,64.35,19.45,22.68,18.25,29.35,81.6,56.16,43.31,6.78,3.07,0.33,0.98,0.2,0.98,0.2,3.72,13.96,8.48,1.76,13.31,5.81,3.07,5.22,1.17,12.98,4.57,3.59,8.41,2.28,1.17,5.09,10.89,1.11,9.72,1.89,2.02,0.98,1.11,0.46,3.52,0,2.94,1.57,1.37,0.65,0.33,0.33,0.13,0.07,0,0,16.44,7.44,0.52,0.52,1.11,0.91,3.33,7.96,0.33,0,0.98,1.96,3.65,3.26,0.07,0.33,5.35,0.07,0.39,4.04,0.91,0.2,2.22,0.07,0,0,0,0,1.7,0.07,0.13,0.07,0.2,0.33,0,0.07,0,0.26,0.65,0.13,3.59,7.11,0.72,1.17,4.96,0.13,0.07,0.2,3.46,4.63,4.04,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,21.72,6.2,6.78,0,0.07,1.89,6.78,0,0.2,0,0.07,0.07,0.26,3.61,3.93,3.34,3.57,3.01,-3.44,-1.98,-1.09,-1.54,-1.7,0.72,0.26,0.39,0.2,0.98,0.59,0.46,0,1.04,0.07,0.26,0.39,1.17,0.2,0.2,0,0.07,0.07,0,0.07,0,0,0,0,1.92,1.09,17.27,71.75,0.65,293.54,-0.46,123.94,0.98,273.97,2.48,32.62,-0.33,247.88,-0.33,345.73,0,65.23,-0.07,26.09,0.26,26.09,0,45.66,156.56,123.94,71.75,19.57,84.8,-0.07,110.89,97.85,6.52,39.14,0,0,0,58.71,13.05,130.46,97.85,58.71,0,0.98,1,0.75,0.44,0.12,0,0,0.06,0.19,0,0.5,0.37,0.12,0,1
11/11/15,19,Opinion,"MICHAEL MORRIS: ""Perverts and freaks"" preferred to haters ","Ba ck more than four decades, a relative of mine was the star of a televised fundraiser. He‚Äôs not much older than me, and I was still young enough to marvel that someone I know would show up on the same box that sent Jan Brady and Scooby Doo into my house.
He was, literally, a poster child at a time when people like him were ignored and ridiculed for a condition over which he had no control. People judged him and it wasn‚Äôt OK for their own children to have him as a friend.
That was the life of people with mental retardation and developmental disabilities back in the late 1960s and early ‚Äô70s. It was shameful for our society that still had trouble with accepting people who were different than themselves, even if those differences were genetic.
While, thankfully, society has grown up when it comes to how the MRDD community is accepted and allowed to participate, my relative remains the emotional equivalent of a pre-teen. In some ways, when it comes to accepting those different than ourselves, the same can be said of America.
We ridicule them, bully them and try to keep them out of our uncomfortable sights.
That much was obvious when we asked on Facebook for people‚Äôs reaction last week to the defeat of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance. The assaults on the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender community, known as LGBT, were pathetic and shameful.
Among the terms used to describe those whose sexuality is outside mainstream acceptance were ‚Äúperverts‚Äù and ‚Äúfreaks.‚Äù
In insulting them, however, they were assaulting friends and family members who I care for, masking their disgusting judgments in religion and morality. Literally, HERO supporters were being castigated by the holier-than-thou.
I can tell you from experience, from knowing people who are openly gay ‚Äî they were born that way. And those who treat them with outward contempt, I can tell them their judgment is purely one of hate.
I‚Äôm not an expert on the Bible, but I have done a bit of research and I can‚Äôt find any passages or parable where Jesus tells us hating is an acceptable Christian behavior. Quite the contrary.
‚ÄúIf anyone says, ‚ÄòI love God,‚Äô and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.‚Äù (1 John 4:20).
To those who wish to respond with Romans 1:26-27 that begins with, ‚ÄúFor this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions‚Äù that anti-gay folks like to cite as the Bible calling out homosexual behavior as a sin, they should pause a second at a mirror. The person staring back at them, like all of us, is a sinner.
That includes the man who checked out the waitress, the family jealous of a friend‚Äôs much nicer home and the child who slipped a pack of gum into their pocket without paying for it.
We are quick to forgive those behaviors, three of the commandments God sent down from Mount Sinai. But when asked to accept those who identify as LGBT as our brothers and sisters, we instead label them freaks and perverts because of who they choose to love.
If what pours forth from their hearts is a sin, so is the hatred that pours forth from the hearts of those who cast stones upon them. ‚ÄúFor out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander‚Äù (Matthew 15:19).
It is your right to not accept the way those in the LGBT community live their lives.
It also is my right to not ascribe to the hate which fuels yours.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,619,57.54,82.66,21.28,6.36,21.34,19.06,88.53,68.01,57.03,17.12,11.95,2.26,1.62,0.48,1.94,3.39,5.17,15.19,7.43,2.1,15.02,7.59,2.91,7.27,1.62,13.73,4.52,2.75,5.82,3.55,0.32,2.1,10.82,0.32,10.34,1.62,1.29,1.45,1.29,0.32,5.01,0,7.27,2.75,4.36,3.07,0.81,2.1,0,1.29,0,0,21,6.62,0.32,0,1.45,2.75,1.45,14.7,0.81,0.32,0.48,2.58,0.16,0,0.16,0,2.75,0,0.32,0.32,0.16,1.94,2.91,0,0,0,0,0,1.62,0.16,0.16,0,0.32,0.97,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0.16,6.46,6.3,0.32,0.65,5.01,0.65,0,0,2.58,5.17,5.33,0.16,0.16,0,0.16,0,0,16.16,4.68,6.3,0,0,1.29,3.88,0,0.65,0,0.48,0.16,1.29,2.9,2.8,2.56,2.17,2.49,-1.37,-0.6,0.27,-0.41,-1.07,0,0.97,1.13,0.48,0.32,0.65,0.81,0,0.48,0.16,1.45,1.45,0.81,0,1.94,0.48,0,0.16,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,2.79,2.1,18.05,371.57,0.65,597.74,-2.26,161.55,0.97,113.09,0.48,64.62,-0.65,226.17,-0.32,210.02,0,113.09,0.32,161.55,1.62,0,0,64.62,48.47,323.1,129.24,0,64.62,-0.32,161.55,80.78,0,16.16,16.16,-0.16,0,129.24,0,64.62,113.09,16.16,0,0.65,1,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0.32,0.16,0,1
11/11/15,19,B,Teacher: Firing was tied to transgender child ,"An educator this week filed a federal discrimination complaint against a learning center in Katy, alleging that she was wrongly fired for refusing to address a 6-year-old girl as a transgender boy, the teacher's attorneys said Tuesday.
Madeline Kirksey, a former employee of the Children's Lighthouse Learning Center on Clay Road in Katy, was fired Nov. 3 after she would not agree to treat the child as a male and call the child by a new male name, according to a copy of a filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission provided by her attorneys.
Kirksey had served as the Kids Club manager for the local franchise since August 2014, which involved overseeing nearly 100 kids, said Briscoe Cain, an attorney representing Kirksey. Her firing occurred the same day that voters repealed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO.
Another of Kirksey's attorneys, Andy Taylor, who also represented the plaintiffs who challenged HERO when it was passed by the Houston City Council, pointed to her protected class as a black female over age 40 who holds religious convictions. He said that her ""essence"" had been violated. ""All of those rights were not vindicated but destroyed,"" Taylor said at a morning news conference.
In brief remarks, Kirksey said she took offense first because of her beliefs. ""I trust God,"" the Houston resident said.
A spokesman for Children's Lighthouse Learning Centers, which operates franchise locations in multiple states, said by phone Tuesday that he could not comment on matters related to employment. But when pressed by a reporter on whether Kirksey was terminated over her handling of a transgender student, the spokesman said no.
""What's unfortunate here is that a teacher who was fired from a school for a variety of issues decided to call a news station,"" said the spokesman, Jamie Izaks. ""This teacher had an agenda behind it and was very opportunistic with a recent vote and discussion in Houston.""
'A real issue'
The learning center franchises, first established in Fort Worth, provide child care for kids ranging from 6 weeks old to age 13. Those between 6 and 13 are typically in an after-school program, rather than full-day, Izaks said.
The company promotes itself online as ""the leading values-based educational child care system in the U.S."" Izaks said the schools are accepting of all religions and have a reputation for nurturing and raising great students.
Taylor stressed that the child had been attending the school since the start of classes as a ""little girl.""
Using fake names, Taylor said that the child left school Friday as ""Sally"" and returned on Monday going by ""Johnny."" ""They had a real issue on their hands,"" Taylor said of the school staff.
The right response
The child reportedly showed up Monday with a short haircut, and Taylor said the child's gender identity wasn't set in stone.
He said the child continued to use the girls' bathroom. The 6-year-old also played football with the boys and, when hit hard, cried and said, ""I'm really not a little boy."" Taylor likened the imposition of such a decision over gender on a child to ""child abuse."" At such a young age, he said, kids haven't even decided what ice cream or cereal they prefer.
As such, the attorney praised Kirksey for standing up not only because of religious reasons but also to protect the child from ridicule and to keep the other children at the school in mind who would have been ""mightily"" confused.
Other children might have thought of the student's announcement that her gender had changed as a ""cruel game of opposite day,"" Taylor said.
The issue of how to respond to young kids who announce they are transgender in a classroom is not one limited to the Katy area, Taylor noted.
""It's time to take a stand, to push back,"" he said.
Of the pertinence of the case nationwide, Cain said: ""We'd be blindfolding ourselves if we were to say this was an isolated incident.""
'Need to be prepared'
The Houston ISD prohibits discrimination against students based on gender identity and expression.
Learning Center teachers are trained to respond appropriately to students who present a variety of issues at school, Izaks said.
""One day they think they're a super hero, the next day they think they're the king of the world,"" the spokesman said. ""... You need to be prepared for everything.""
The EEOC enforces federal discrimination laws on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. A spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny that the complaint had been filed.
Lawyers said they plan soon to file a second complaint on behalf of a bus driver for the center who was also recently fired.

11/11/15,19,City Hall,Mayor to Dan Patrick: Dallas' LGBT protections are not 'about where people relieve themselves' ,"The same people who helped kill Houston‚Äôs Equal Rights Ordinance last week just discovered Dallas has had one on the books for 13 years. And they are not happy about that at all.
On Tuesday the Dallas City Council voted unanimously to fine-tune some language in a long-standing anti-bias ordinance to distinguish between ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression,‚Äù two things initially grouped together in the definition of ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù when Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code was approved in 2002. The city‚Äôs LGBT Task Force worked on the amendment for a year ‚Äî ever since Dallas voters overwhelmingly passed a charter amendment in November 2014 that added both ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù to the list of protections for city employees.
The ordinance prohibits discrimination in employment, public accommodations and housing.
But in a statement released this morning ‚Äî one that bore the headline ‚ÄúPatrick Statement on Dallas Bathroom Ordinance‚Äù ‚Äî Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick yet again insists the ordinance is intended ‚Äúto allow men in women‚Äôs restrooms,‚Äù echoing his opposition to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which was defeated last week. He joins state Sen. Don Huffines, a Dallas Republican, in calling for its repeal.
‚ÄúI was very proud to help lead the recent effort where an overwhelming majority of voters in Houston successfully voted down the misnamed and misguided HERO ordinance,‚Äù says Patrick‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why yesterday‚Äôs decision by the Dallas City Council, in closed session, to fast-track the enactment of a similar ordinance to allow men in women‚Äôs restrooms is both mind-boggling and appalling.‚Äù
The vote was conducted in open session ‚Äî because the council cannot take votes behind closed doors. And after it passed, 15-0, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said that Dallas is ‚Äúvery diverse, and we want to make sure everyone is protected.‚Äù
In a statement offered as a response to Patrick‚Äôs, Rawlings said Wednesday afternoon that ‚Äúour job as City Council members is to represent the citizens of Dallas. While we respect others‚Äô points of view, our goal is to protect all of our citizens, including minority groups.‚Äù
Said Rawlings, ‚ÄúYesterday‚Äôs unanimous City Council vote did not change the scope of our 13-year-old anti-discrimination ordinance. We took action that is consistent with what our voters approved last year and the protections already afforded to our employees. It is not forthright or honest to minimize this issue to a question about where people relieve themselves.‚Äù
As the Texas Tribune points out today, Dallas is one of several Texas cities with laws on the books intended to protect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees and residents. Also on the list: Fort Worth, Arlington, Austin, Plano, San Antonio, El Paso, Waco and Brownsville.
‚ÄúThe Lieutenant Governor is infamous for fomenting mob mentality against the interests of minorities,‚Äù says Dallas City Council member Philip Kingston via email. ‚ÄúIn Dallas we believe in equal protection under law.‚Äù
Says Dallas City Council member Adam Medrano, chair of the city‚Äôs LGBT Task Force, Patrick and Huffines are dispensing the same ‚Äúmisinformation that killed the HERO ordinance in Houston. It‚Äôs made up of non-truths. This is not a bathroom ordinance. This is about making sure everyone in the city of Dallas is treated equally.‚Äù
Not so long ago the gay community was furious with Rawlings after he refused to bring a marriage equality vote to the city council, proclaiming it a non-issue over which the council had no control. But in the last 18 months, following a low score on the Human Rights Campaign Municipal Equality Index, the council revised the city‚Äôs Family Medical Leave Ordinance to include a ‚Äúdesignated care recipient,‚Äù and extended pension benefits to the partners of gay and lesbian police officers and firefighters. The city also updated its health-care plan to cover some transgender services.
Medrano says amending Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code was just the ‚Äúlast piece‚Äù of the task force‚Äôs recent work. But to the lieutenant governor, it‚Äôs the final straw.
‚ÄúThis ordinance isn‚Äôt about discrimination, it‚Äôs about political correctness ‚Äî and Dallas city leaders have put political correctness ahead of both common sense and common decency,‚Äù says Patrick‚Äôs statement. ‚ÄúThe facts are clear. No woman wants a man to be allowed in a ladies restroom or locker room, no matter the reason. And no man wants his wife, daughter, mother, or sister to be forced by law to contend with such an uncomfortable, disruptive, and potentially dangerous intrusion. This ludicrous ordinance, like the one in Houston, reveals officials who are totally out of touch with Texas values.‚Äù
Medrano says the city is taking steps to ‚Äúput the truth out there‚Äù concerning yesterday‚Äôs council action, including reaching out to local legislators. Council members are posting to social media, and Medrano says the city will issue a statement later today. But in the meantime, one of the state‚Äôs most powerful legislators is calling for its repeal.
Yesterday, following the vote, Huffines took to Twitter to attack ‚ÄúDallas‚Äô new sneak-attack LGBT ordinance,‚Äù and said the council had engaged in ‚ÄúObama & Pelosi style sneak-attack governance.‚Äù Kingston told him, via Twitter, to ‚Äústop lying.‚Äù Shortly after that exchange, Huffines launched an online petition intended to ‚ÄúKeep Men Out Of Women‚Äôs Restrooms!‚Äù
Today, says Kingston via email, ‚ÄúThe Lieutenant Governor should try to know something before he shoots his mouth off.‚Äù
Says Patrick in his prepared statement, ‚ÄúI have no doubt that if this issue is put to the voters, as opposed to being decided without adequate public notice and discussion, the people of Dallas ‚Äî like those in Houston ‚Äî will give it a resounding no.‚Äù
But as Kingston and Medrano point out, the issue was put to the voters last November. ‚ÄúAnd,‚Äù says Medrano, ‚Äúit passed with 77 percent of the vote.‚Äù

Here is the original Dallas Morning News story that ran on May 9, 2002, about the initial passage of Dallas‚Äô anti-discrimination ordinance.
Ordinance protecting gays OK‚Äôd
Discrimination ban in Dallas includes housing, employment
By COLLEEN McCAIN NELSON/Staff Writer
Dallas City Council members approved an ordinance Wednesday aimed at protecting gays and lesbians, saying that the anti- discrimination measure was long overdue.
The council voted, 13-2, to adopt the ordinance, which prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation in housing, employment and such public places as hotels and restaurants. Violations would be punishable by fines of $200 to $500.
Dallas becomes one of several dozen U.S. cities that have prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation. Fort Worth, Houston and Austin have approved similar measures. Prominent business executives, including American Airlines chairman and chief executive officer Donald J. Carty, and a Methodist minister were among the few dozen people who expressed support for the ordinance. Two people spoke against it.
Mr. Carty, who spoke of the success of American‚Äôs anti-discrimination policies, told the council that passing the ordinance is a good business decision. ‚ÄúUltimately, the issue transcends self-interest to something more important,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúTaking a stand against discrimination ‚Äî whether based on race, gender, religion, class, sexual orientation or anything else ‚Äî is not politically correct. It is simply correct.‚Äù
On the mayoral campaign trail, Laura Miller promised to make enacting the ordinance a top priority. Ms. Miller and council members John Loza, Veletta Forsythe Lill, Ed Oakley and Elba Garcia worked with gay and lesbian leaders to draft the proposal.
Mr. Loza told his colleagues that their decision reaffirmed the worth of every Dallas resident.
‚ÄúI have always been proud of Dallas,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs a gay man, today I am especially proud of my city.‚Äù
Mr. Oakley, who is also gay, said the ordinance simply ensured that all people are treated fairly.
‚ÄúIf you think ... that we‚Äôre trying to give special rights to individuals, that is not the case,‚Äù he said.
Council members Alan Walne and Mitchell Rasansky voted against the measure, saying it would cost too much to enforce and would pose an added burden for small-business owners.
Employers with more than 15 workers must comply. Religious organizations and state and federal offices will be exempt. Substantiated complaints will be sent to mediation. Those that remain unresolved will go to the city attorney.
Mr. Walne said he could not justify the expense of enforcing the ordinance when the city is facing a significant budget shortfall.
Two full-time staff members will be assigned to investigate complaints, and a city attorney will work part time on enforcement. The annual cost of salaries and equipment will be about $169,000. The city staff said employees will be reassigned to enforce the ordinance, bringing the cost of the policy down to $15,000.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just making a statement; we‚Äôre adding a cost,‚Äù Mr. Walne said.
Clint Freeman, who urged the council to reject the ordinance, said the proposal would regulate or even outlaw beliefs that homosexuality is wrong.
‚ÄúContrary to the implications of the ordinance, there seems to be no evidence of a problem,‚Äù he said.
But Hector Garcia, former chairman of the city‚Äôs Plan Commission and a Texas Human Rights Foundation board member, told the council that discrimination and bigotry are evident in Texas.
‚ÄúRegardless of how you personally feel about gays, lesbians, the transgendered and bisexuals, know that we are your constituents,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe ... deserve the same protections afforded everyone else.‚Äù",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,1533,89.16,64.35,19.45,22.68,18.25,29.35,81.6,56.16,43.31,6.78,3.07,0.33,0.98,0.2,0.98,0.2,3.72,13.96,8.48,1.76,13.31,5.81,3.07,5.22,1.17,12.98,4.57,3.59,8.41,2.28,1.17,5.09,10.89,1.11,9.72,1.89,2.02,0.98,1.11,0.46,3.52,0,2.94,1.57,1.37,0.65,0.33,0.33,0.13,0.07,0,0,16.44,7.44,0.52,0.52,1.11,0.91,3.33,7.96,0.33,0,0.98,1.96,3.65,3.26,0.07,0.33,5.35,0.07,0.39,4.04,0.91,0.2,2.22,0.07,0,0,0,0,1.7,0.07,0.13,0.07,0.2,0.33,0,0.07,0,0.26,0.65,0.13,3.59,7.11,0.72,1.17,4.96,0.13,0.07,0.2,3.46,4.63,4.04,1.37,0,0,0,0,0,21.72,6.2,6.78,0,0.07,1.89,6.78,0,0.2,0,0.07,0.07,0.26,3.61,3.93,3.34,3.57,3.01,-3.44,-1.98,-1.09,-1.54,-1.7,0.72,0.26,0.39,0.2,0.98,0.59,0.46,0,1.04,0.07,0.26,0.39,1.17,0.2,0.2,0,0.07,0.07,0,0.07,0,0,0,0,1.92,1.09,17.27,71.75,0.65,293.54,-0.46,123.94,0.98,273.97,2.48,32.62,-0.33,247.88,-0.33,345.73,0,65.23,-0.07,26.09,0.26,26.09,0,45.66,156.56,123.94,71.75,19.57,84.8,-0.07,110.89,97.85,6.52,39.14,0,0,0,58.71,13.05,130.46,97.85,58.71,0,0.98,1,0.75,0.44,0.12,0,0,0.06,0.19,0,0.5,0.37,0.12,0,1
11/10/15,19,News,"It's our turn, again, for an LGBT battle ","Two cities, in two elections, provided one telling intersection last week in America's latest fight for equality.
One election, in Charlotte, resulted in a new City Council poised to reintroduce an anti-discrimination ordinance that includes protections for transgender people. The other election, in Houston, shows how challenging that battle will be.
In Charlotte, voters elected Democrats to the council's four at-large seats, ensuring the same 9-2 majority as the previous council. The difference this time is at-large members Michael Barnes and David Howard - who in March voted against at least of some of the anti-discrimination ordinance - will leave the council in December. They'll be replaced by Julie Eiselt and James ""Smuggie"" Mitchell, who've said they'd support expanding protections to the LGBT community.
In Houston, however, anti-LGBT activists showed how to defeat such an ordinance. After that city's council passed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) 18 months ago, opponents of the ordinance gathered enough signatures to get a referendum on the issue in front of voters last week.
The activists also launched a distasteful campaign that characterized the ordinance, which protected 15 classes of people, as a vehicle for sex offenders to prey on children in bathrooms. It worked: voters rejected HERO by a 22-point margin last Tuesday.
The same could happen here. Even if Charlotte's City Council passed a new anti-discrimination ordinance, voters across the city could get their say on it. All it would take is the conservative N.C. General Assembly passing a local act allowing for a referendum.
At the least, a reintroduction of the ordinance would result in the same debate that roiled Charlotte back in March. It will be uncomfortable. It will bring out the worst in some of us.
But Charlotte's City Council shouldn't shy away from the discussion, or the fight.
Instead, council members should remind the public that most large cities offer protections for the LGBT community, and that we look comparatively regressive to the businesses, young workers and big events that might be looking our way.
They should also note that while opponents of anti-discrimination ordinances like to make them all about the bathrooms, there are no documented cases of perverts taking advantage of such ordinances to poke around women's bathrooms or pursue children. None.
That is, by the way, the same kind of scary diversion anti-gay activists long used in their fight against laws protecting the rights of homosexuals. It's just as hateful now.
More and more, Americans are realizing this. The day before the Houston vote, the U.S. Department of Education supported a transgender student in Illinois who wanted to use the school restrooms and locker room. Also last week, the Maryland State Department of Education issued guidelines for schools so that they can support transgender and gender non-conforming students.
As with many minorities, the fight for equality will be rocky. But those hard steps have to be taken. Those difficult conversations should be welcomed, not avoided. It's Charlotte's turn, again.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,493,90.85,46.05,36.56,6.32,16.43,29.01,82.76,59.84,47.26,7.3,2.43,0,0.61,0,0,1.42,4.87,17.44,9.53,1.83,14.6,6.49,3.65,4.87,0.81,12.98,6.49,5.48,5.27,1.62,0.61,3.25,10.14,0.81,9.33,0.61,1.62,2.03,1.22,0,4.26,0.2,4.87,1.62,3.25,0.81,0,0.81,0.2,0.41,0,0,12.58,5.88,0.61,0.2,1.42,1.22,1.22,5.48,0,0,0.2,0,3.65,3.65,0,0,3.65,0,0.2,3.45,0.2,0,1.62,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,0.81,0,0,0.41,0.2,1.22,0,0.2,0,0.2,1.42,0.2,3.85,9.94,0.41,2.03,6.9,0.61,0,0.2,4.46,2.64,2.03,1.83,0,0,0,0,0,18.86,6.69,5.88,0,0,2.64,3.65,0,0.2,0,0.41,0,0,3.31,3.29,3.16,3.44,2.58,-2.86,-0.74,-0.66,-1.41,-1.1,0.2,1.22,0,0.81,1.22,0.41,0.41,0,0.41,0,0,0.2,0.61,0.61,1.01,0,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,1.67,1.47,16.32,223.12,1.01,304.26,1.42,101.42,0.61,182.56,1.42,40.57,-0.41,304.26,-0.61,223.12,0,121.7,-0.2,40.57,0.41,0,0,101.42,182.56,101.42,20.28,0,141.99,0.41,162.27,121.7,0,0,0,0,0,101.42,0,202.84,101.42,20.28,0,0.81,1,0,0.81,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.61,0,1
11/10/15,19,City Hall,"Kleinman: 'This is not a bathroom ordinance, it is an anti-discrimination ordinance update' ","Update at 5 p.m.: In response to numerous phone calls and tweets, such as this one from conservative talk-show host Dana Loesch to Dallas City Council member Philip Kingston, council member Lee Kleinman wants to make one thing very, very clear: ‚ÄúThis is not a bathroom ordinance, it is an anti-discrimination ordinance update.‚Äù
As noted earlier today, this is the update of an ordinance dating back to 2002 that protects the LGBT community from discrimination. And as Kleinman points out, last November Dallas residents voted 77 percent in favor of a charter amendment adding both ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù to the list of protections for city employees. Says Kleinman via email, ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs action updated an ordinance to be consistent with that charter amendment as well as Chapter 34&Prime; of the Dallas City Code, which deals with personnel rules and was updated in September 2014.
The Dallas City Attorney‚Äôs Office also offers this summary of today‚Äôs update, for those still confused:
Dallas‚Äôs anti-discrimination ordinance was approved by the city council in 2002 and had not been amended since. The primary purpose of today‚Äôs amendment was to distinguish between the terms ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression,‚Äù which were grouped together in the definition of the term ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù when the original 2002 ordinance was passed. The ordinance as originally approved in 2002 prohibits discrimination in employment, public accommodations, and housing on the basis of both sexual orientation and gender identity; today‚Äôs amendment simply defines gender identity separately from sexual orientation, and changes the wording of Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code to reflect these separate definitions. With this change, the definitions of ‚Äúsexual orientation‚Äù and ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù in Chapter 46 now match the definitions in the city‚Äôs personnel rules.
Update at 1:30 p.m.: Since the Dallas City Council voted to amend the long-standing ordinance, state Sen. Don Huffines, a first-term Republican, has been tweeting that it was a ‚ÄúObama & Pelosi style sneak-attack governance‚Äù that needs to be repealed. Among his tweets:
Repeal Dallas‚Äô new LGBT ordinance immediately. It was not reviewed or thoughtfully considered by the public. - Don Huffines (@DonHuffines) November 10, 2015
Houston voters soundly said NO to men in women‚Äôs bathrooms. Dallas‚Äô new sneak-attack LGBT ordinance must be repealed & carefully reviewed.
- Don Huffines (@DonHuffines) November 10, 2015
Dallas City Council member Philip Kingston is not impressed:
Went through a year of public discussion and makes no change to the existing public policy of Dallas. Stop lying https://t.co/IIhFU0uVgK
- Philip Kingston (@PhilipTKingston) November 10, 2015
Original post at 11:56 a.m.: Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code, which was passed in May 2002, makes it illegal to discriminate against someone based on sexual orientation. The ordinance, which applies to everything from employment to housing, has defined sexual orientation as ‚Äúan individual‚Äôs real or perceived orientation as heterosexual, homosexual, or bisexual or an individual‚Äôs real or perceived gender identity.‚Äù Which means that for 13 years, the transgender community has been protected in the city of Dallas. But this morning, the council went the extra step by separating sexual orientation from gender identity. The council voted unanimously on the amendment, which now reads, ‚ÄúIt is the policy of the city of Dallas to bring about through fair, orderly, and lawful procedures the opportunity for every person to obtain employment, access to all places of public accommodation, and housing, without regard to sexual orientation or gender identity and expression.‚Äù
The city‚Äôs LGBT Task Force, of which council member Adam Medrano is chair, has been working on the new language for more than a year.
Despite the long-standing definition in the city code, ‚Äúthe transgender community believes they‚Äôre not included because the definition of gender identity is stuffed into sexual orientation,‚Äù LGBT task force member Patti Fink told the council shortly before the vote. She asked the council to pass the amendment ‚Äúso it‚Äôs clear to those who live in this city [that] they have protections.‚Äù
Said Fink, with the amendment transgender individuals can ‚Äúsee themselves in this ordinance very clearly. This move makes that possible. They don‚Äôt have to look under one line in Section 18 for the definition of sexual orientation to make sure gender identity is included.‚Äù
Following a lengthy closed-door discussion about the amendment at Monday‚Äôs Quality of Life Committee meeting, it was unclear if there‚Äôd be much discussion among the full council. There wasn‚Äôt any, save for a few words from Medrano about the task force‚Äôs work (‚Äúwe‚Äôve been able to do a lot for equality‚Äù) and a brief hear, hear from the mayor.
‚ÄúWords have meaning,‚Äùsaid Rafael McDonnell of the Resource Center, ‚Äúand your vote today will give life to those words and will be seen not only here in Dallas but around the country as support for the LGBT community.‚Äù
The council voted unanimously to amend the ordinance ‚Äî a far cry from what happened in Houston last week, where voters opposed a similar ordinance.
Dallas, said Mayor Mike Rawlings following today‚Äôs vote, is ‚Äúvery diverse, and we want to make sure everyone is protected.‚Äù",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,854,92.65,36.7,43.46,23.18,27.55,27.99,80.33,55.5,43.09,5.74,1.17,0,0.23,0.12,0.23,0.47,4.57,12.88,8.43,3.28,15.11,5.5,3.04,5.5,1.17,12.06,4.92,3.28,4.1,1.52,0.47,1.99,11.36,0.7,10.54,2.34,2.11,0.7,1.41,0.7,3.98,0,1.87,1.05,0.82,0.35,0,0.35,0,0,0.12,0,11.36,4.57,0.23,0.12,0.47,0.12,2.69,4.22,0,0,0.23,0.7,2.69,2.34,0,0.35,3.63,0,0.47,3.16,0,0,2.93,0,0,0,0,0,2.46,0,0,0.12,0.23,0.12,0.23,0.23,0,0.12,0.7,0,3.51,8.43,0.82,1.05,5.62,0.47,0.35,0,5.15,4.8,4.33,0.82,0.47,0.47,0,0,0,22.13,4.45,5.74,0,0,2.58,9.37,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0.12,3.29,3.26,2.81,2.97,2.87,-2.7,-1.79,-0.15,-1.35,-0.77,0.7,0.47,0,0,0.35,0.47,0.82,0,0.35,0.12,0,1.41,1.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.78,0.84,15.78,93.79,0.94,246.19,0.7,164.13,1.41,246.19,2.23,46.89,-0.23,199.3,0,281.36,0,117.23,-0.12,0,0,0,0,23.45,175.85,58.62,0,23.45,58.62,0,105.51,281.36,11.72,93.79,11.72,0.12,0,70.34,0,82.06,46.89,23.45,11.72,0.12,1,0.45,0.22,0.11,0,0,0,0.9,0,0.22,0,0.34,0,1
11/10/15,19,news,The way I see it - News media and Democrat narratives ,"The second column in November always falls close to Veterans Day, on the 11th. Those who have worn the uniforms of, in no special order, the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, the Army or the Coast Guard deserve, and are assured of, the respect and gratitude of a nation composed primarily of civilians. Due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of ever-present disagreements and disputes, otherwise peacetime service can be only a hair trigger away from wartime service‚Äîall are to be commended for putting country first. Thank you, veterans.
Over the last week, elections have sent messages, candidates have honed their messages and members of the news media have exercised shameless manipulation and attempted control of the messages. In a ‚Äúmove along‚Äînothing to see here‚Äù moment, voters delivered numerous body blows to the Democrat paradigm of progressive inevitability. In ‚ÄúRepublican Victories Highlight 2016 Stakes,‚Äù a writer at The American Interest wrote, ‚ÄúLast night was a banner night for conservatives, who defeated a number of measures in liberal strongholds, including a transgender bathroom ordinance in Houston, a $15 minimum wage ordinance in Portland, Maine, and a proposed law restricting AirBnB rentals in San Francisco.
‚ÄúBut the most consequential GOP victory came in Kentucky‚Äîa deep red state in presidential elections that has nonetheless had Democratic governors for 40 out of the last 44 years‚Äîwhere the conservative populist insurgent Matt Bevin won the statehouse for Republicans by an almost nine point margin.‚Äù Democrat deep pockets also failed to sway voters in nearby Virginia, where Clinton- ista Governor Terry McAuliffe put it all on the line to gain his party‚Äôs control over the legislature. However, Democrat money prevailed in Pennsylvania Supreme Court contests, illustrating the priority the left gives to having the black-robed judicial branch in their corner.
Conservative electoral gains must be tempered by the reality of leftist/liberal dominance in entertainment, secondary and higher education, the regulatory branch, Obama‚Äôs appointed judges, among government employees, their unions‚Äîand the journalist class. News media leans left and left-er depending on proximity to local markets, with the major metropolitan broadcast, cable and print outlets‚Äîparticularly the New York/Washington, D.C. beltway elite‚Äîbeing dominated by Democrats.
It‚Äôs not really disputable; ‚ÄúRepublicans‚Äô media bias claims boosted by scarcity of right-leaning journalists,‚Äù by Kelly Riddell, illustrated as much in the Washington Times. Party identification, voting patterns, positions on issues and contributions lean, at the minimum, 3 or 4 to 1 in favor of the Democrat left, and up to 9 to 1 among the beltway media elites.
Of citizen-elected representatives, the local and state levels have seen a massive diminishment of Democrat-held seats, legislatures and governors while Obama has held the presidency. ‚ÄúThis creates an interesting dynamic. Because the Democrats‚Äô ranks have been eviscerated at lower levels of office, the stakes for winning the White House couldn‚Äôt be higher. If the party loses the White House in 2016, it will have almost nothing left.
‚ÄúThe prospect of losing everything creates an incentive for Democrats to double down even further on their presidential coalition (i.e. Hillary endorsed the Houston transgender ordinance). But this strategy‚Äîof appealing more and more strongly to the national base rather than reaching out to new segments of voters‚Äîmakes them even less competitive in off-year and state-level elections.‚Äù
It might be a rhetorical question, by Jazz Shaw, in ‚ÄúHas the liberal wing of the Democrats finally pushed the party too far?‚Äù but if you look it up, you‚Äôll find an insightful read with quotes from The Hill‚Äôs Alexander Bolton. He explores the question of ‚Äúwhether or not the ascendant, hard left, liberal wing of the Democrats has finally pushed their party to a tipping point in the run-up to the next presidential election.‚Äù Guns and race are prominent in this analysis.
Even casual observers can‚Äôt have missed the gun control/safety/background check rhetoric‚Äîeven thinly veiled references to confiscation. Hillary promises using executive power in furtherance of the issue. California‚Äôs gun-grabbers are cheering Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom‚Äôs ballot measures outlawing ‚Äúlarge capacity,‚Äù but otherwise standard, magazines; requiring background checks for all ammunition purchases; and mandating reporting of lost or stolen guns.
San Franciscans cheer the departure of its last gun store over required photographing of customers. Los Angeles has outlawed handguns widely owned from even being transported through the city. A map I saw showed it to be physically impossible to leave some municipalities without driving through LA and ordinary travel in SoCal is close to impossible with such guns.

11/10/15,19,Cheat Sheet,Houston's Anti-LGBT Campaign Was Led by Wingnut Who Would Evict All Gays ,"HATE
The city's equal-rights ordinance was struck down by voters last week. Secret documents reveal a shocking extremism among those who led the effort.
Last week's repeal of Houston's equal rights ordinance was the biggest setback for the LGBT equality movement in years.
And now, confidential documents provided to The Daily Beast by a leading LGBT rights organization reveal for the first time that the backers of the repeal were not the ""usual suspects"" on the Christian Right, but a uniquely Texan consortium of sword-swinging, Bible-swearing, fire-breathing extremists who want Texas to secede from the union and who pray for God to smite city officials, backed by a shadowy network of mostly anonymous donors.
""Homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they have to recruit, and they start with children.""
First is the lead organizer of the Campaign for Houston, Steve Hotze. If that organization sounds familiar, it's because it is. Back in 1985, Hotze organized the ""Campaign for Houston Straight Slate,"" led by then-mayor Louie Welch who said that the best way to control AIDS would be to ""shoot the queers.""
Credit Hotze for consistency. In 1982, he said of gays that ""they proliferate by one means, and one means only, and that's recruiting. And they recruit the weak. They recruit children or young people in their formative years."" And in May, 2015, he said, ""Homosexuals cannot reproduce, so they have to recruit, and they start with children.""
Hotze is also the founder of the Conservative Republicans of Texas, a home-grown vitamin salesman whose medical treatments have been widely discredited, and the ""singer,"" if that's the word, of two auto-tuned piano pop songs about resisting the ""tyranny of the federal government"" and seceding from the United States (""Texas should be free‚Äîit should be an independent nation"").
""What would Davey Crockett do?"" Hotze sings. ""I know what I'm going to do‚Äîdefeat Obamacare.""
This summer, following the Supreme Court's ruling on same-sex marriage, Hotze launched a ""Faith Family Freedom Tour"" in Houston, at which time he drew a sword and said, ""Our strongest weapon in the fight is the word of God. The word of God is like any two-edged sword. For thousands of years, men fought with swords. Can you imagine that piercing right through the enemy like this? That's what the word of God does. I've decided, I'm not going to fight the homosexuals with sweet words. I'm going to fight them with God's word.""
But of course, the sword is just a metaphor, right? Unclear. ""Drive them out of our city,"" Hotze exhorted. ""I don't want them in our city. Send them back to San Francisco.""
Hotze also distributed a 'manifesto' from 1987 meant to satirize the outrageous claims being made about gay people, and read it aloud as if it were a real manifesto (""We shall sodomize your sons, emblems of your feeble masculinity, of your shallow dreams and vulgar lies."")
Interestingly, Hotze himself signed an actual manifesto, the Coalition on Revival's 1986 ""Manifesto for the Christian Church"" (PDF) that states, among other things, that women must offer their husbands ""gentle, submissive obedience, and not... weary them with constant criticism"" and ""den[ies] that Christians should marry non-Christians, and that sexual attractiveness or other carnal considerations should dictate a Christian's choice of a mate."" Then there's Pastor David Welch. After HERO passed the city council (by a vote of 11-6), Welch was one of the pastors under investigation for improperly soliciting signatures for a political petition in church. This investigation led to the disastrous PR move of the city subpoenaing Welch's sermons, among other records.
It turns out that the subpoena, while terrible optics‚Äîthe City of Houston seemed to be telling pastors what they could and couldn't preach‚Äîwas quite justified. In fact, Welch was in frequent contact with national organizations such as the Alliance Defending Freedom as the anti-HERO fight took shape. And in a video posted last year by Equality Texas, he's seen training people on how to obtain signatures.
Still, of his subpoena, he said, Ben-Carson-like, ""as close as anything I've ever seen to Nazi Germany on our soil."" (Guess he hasn't seen KKK marches or swastikas painted on synagogues.)
But that's just the beginning. Welch also urged ""imprecatory prayers"" against the Houston officials examining the suspect signatures. For those of you who skipped that day of Sunday School, imprecatory prayers are those asking God to smite His enemies.
And in his weekly column for the far-right World Net Daily, Welch said of President Obama, ""A Christian? I doubt it.""
Hotze and Welch were joined by former congressman, and indicted crook Tom Delay. Delay spoke at several anti-HERO events himself, and his longtime lawyer and political crony, Andy Taylor, was also the lawyer for the anti-HERO coalition.
Taylor, incidentally, has not only bailed Delay out several times, but was also the lawyer in Delay's 2003 effort to redraw Texas's congressional districts, for which he billed taxpayers over $750,000.
And let's not forget the group Texas Values, led by extremist Jonathan Saenz (whose wife left him for a woman. Texas Values is, in fact, the lobbying arm of the Liberty Institute, better known as Kim Davis's lawyers.
The Liberty Institute might well be called the Lying Institute. As Media Matters has revealed, they advanced a bogus claim that a soldier was discharged for stating his religious views (in fact, he was at the end of his term), a bogus story that a Texas track star was disqualified after pointing skyward after a run (he was actually giving someone the finger, and, of course, Davis herself.
Saenz has called evolution a ""left-wing ideology"" that ""any respectable scientist"" would disagree with, and called the nonexistent 'War on Christmas' ""a key front in the radical movement to remove all religious expression from the public square.""
These local activists were assisted by national right-wing organizations, led by the Alliance Defending Freedom, Focus on the Family, and Family Research Council. That partnership of local extremists and national names is one reason the anti-HERO campaign was so successful. For example, the locals' initial anti-HERO message was ""Unequal Rights,"" an anodyne phrase that sounds like a 1990s throwback. Smart consultants shifted it to ""No Men in Women's Bathrooms,"" a ""Big Lie"" that convinced many voters that the anti-discrimination ordinance was really about sexual predators in restrooms.
That's the strategy that ADF and its ilk are now preparing to replicate Houston nationwide.
Finally, there is the tangled web of dark money that bankrolled the HERO repeal. Documents provided to the Daily Beast reveal a plethora of committees involved, including the Conservative Republicans of Texas, Conservative Republicans of Harris County, Campaign for Texas Families, Citizens for American Restoration. But all have the same treasurer, Bart Standley.
And they seem interrelated. For example, the Campaign For Houston (run by Hotze) donated $79,000 to Conservative Republicans of Harris County (also run by Hotze).
Then there's a separate, statewide Campaign For Houston, with separate donors and separate finances. In its filings with the State Ethics Commission, this Campaign For Houston included two line items totaling $200,350, and listed merely as ""American Express."" The Campaign For Texas Families, meanwhile, received $50,000 from the Texas Family Values PAC, and a handful of five-figure individual donors.
The leading individual donors appear to be real estate executive Allen Hartman, who donated a total of $206,000, and Steve Hotze himself, who gave $146,000.
That money bought a lot of lies. An equal rights ordinance meant to protect LGBT people from being fired from their jobs was twisted into a law meant to let men use women's restrooms. A broad coalition of racial and gender justice organizations were depicted as a radical gay lobby. And transgender people were demonized, misrepresented, and denied their very existence.
But perhaps the biggest lie of all was that the opposition to HERO was led by a broad, faith-based coalition of moderates and conservatives. Hardly. It was led, and won, by the wingnuts.",Campaign for Houston ,1,1325,86.46,68.28,11.39,17.6,17.91,25.21,82.04,57.28,46.42,9.21,5.06,0.6,0.45,0.38,1.51,1.43,4.15,14.72,8.91,1.74,14.11,6.57,2.72,5.74,0.83,12,5.13,2.87,7.17,2.11,0.83,4.45,9.21,0.38,8.83,2.04,1.21,1.13,1.58,0.6,2.94,0.08,3.17,1.43,1.66,0.45,0,0.38,0,0.23,0,0,14.64,7.02,1.06,0,1.13,0.68,1.89,8.38,0.53,0.15,0.45,1.96,4.23,3.62,0.53,0.08,5.66,0.15,0.08,2.94,0.75,1.96,1.74,0.38,0,0.08,0,0,0.98,0.08,0.15,0.38,0.15,0.3,0,0,0.08,0.23,0.38,0.23,3.25,6.57,0.08,0.83,4.45,0.91,0.23,0,3.25,5.66,3.02,1.28,0,0,0,0,0,24.68,5.43,8.08,0.3,0,2.72,8.15,0,0.23,0,0.3,0,0,3,3.07,2.95,3.07,2.55,-2.84,-1.52,-0.27,-0.79,-1.39,0.38,0.45,0,0.45,1.13,0.23,1.58,0.15,0.45,0,1.58,0.15,0.45,0,0.38,0,0.08,0.15,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,2.17,1.26,16.5,113.21,0.75,377.36,-0.83,128.3,1.21,196.23,1.51,83.02,-0.38,286.79,0.75,249.06,0,181.13,0.53,120.75,1.21,22.64,0,67.92,150.94,90.57,60.38,0,90.57,0.38,128.3,45.28,7.55,37.74,7.55,0.08,0,90.57,22.64,98.11,45.28,7.55,7.55,0.23,1,0,0.68,0.15,0,0,0.08,0.15,0.38,0,0.15,0.08,0,1

11/9/15,19,City Hall,"Tomorrow, Dallas council will vote on adding 'gender identity and expression' protections ","A proposal to add ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù to the city of Dallas‚Äô anti-discrimination ordinance stirred concern at City Hall this morning.
Supporters, led by council member Adam Medrano, said the proposed change to the city‚Äôs law was just some much-needed paperwork ‚Äî ‚Äúclean-up language‚Äù to clarify the protections the city already offers.
In a memo to colleagues late Friday, Medrano wrote that amending the existing ordinance would show that ‚Äúa person‚Äôs gender is determined by the person‚Äôs own perception of their gender.‚Äù And it would make it illegal to deny housing to someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The proposed rewrite also erases an exemption that previously said property owners could deny renting rooms ‚Äúto persons of the same sex when the dwelling contains common lavatory, kitchen or similar facilities available for the use of all persons occupying the dwelling.‚Äù
Per Dallas City Attorney Warren Ernst, Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code has defined sexual orientation to include ‚Äúreal or perceived gender identity‚Äù since it was first enacted in 2002.
Council member Rick Callahan, of Pleasant Grove, wasn‚Äôt prepared to sign off on the amendment without discussion.
He said he‚Äôd been out of town at National League of Cities in Nashville (where he said he was running for a board position), just got back in town last night, and hadn‚Äôt had time to read the memo. Said Callahan, he‚Äôs been ‚Äúextremely busy‚Äù and, well, adding this to council‚Äôs voting agenda tomorrow is ‚Äúunfair to the committee and the council.‚Äù
Quality of Life chair Sandy Greyson and two city attorneys told Callahan this isn‚Äôt a change to existing rules, merely a better definition. Said Greyson, adding ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù is merely a ‚Äúfurther explanation of what sexual orientation means.‚Äù
But as we learned in Houston last week, where the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was defeated by voters after it was reduced to the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù by opponents, semantic disputes are often the ugliest.
After nearly 45 minutes behind closed doors, there was no further discussion: Philip Kingston motioned sending the amendment, there was a second and the matter was sent along to the full council for a vote tomorrow.

11/9/15,19,Opinion,HAYLEY ORR: HERO loss won't be end of the fight ,"
Last Tuesday was Election Day, where voters got to express their opinions on many issues. Though perhaps the one that drew the most attention in this area was Houston‚Äôs Proposition 1, Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, also known as HERO. The goal of this piece of legislation was to protect individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation, race, age, military status, disability and several other categories.
However, this proposition became most known for its controversial proposal that transgender people be able to use whichever bathroom in which they feel most comfortable.
With a proposition as contentious as HERO, voter turnout was expected to be higher than usual, and it was. Unfortunately for HERO supporters, voters turned out en masse to overwhelmingly defeat the proposition, 61 percent to 39 percent.
Many conservative groups fought hard against this proposition, turning it into a fight to keep men out of women‚Äôs bathrooms. They ran a very dramatic commercial showing a man waiting on a young girl in the bathroom, warning that this proposition would allow sexual predators into areas where women are supposed to feel safe. To some extent, they had a point. But they made their point based on fear rather than on facts.
Pitting a defenseless young girl against a hardened sexual predator in their most notorious ad fed fears that girls would be victimized should this legislation pass. It is that fear that spurred many voters to show up at the polls to cast their votes against it. Whether this is the right move for Houston has yet to be seen, but I have a sense that the fight is not yet over.
In this day and age, sexual orientation and gender identities are things that all governmental bodies will have to address sooner or later. Whether or not one agrees with these people‚Äôs orientations (or ‚Äúlifestyle choices‚Äù), doesn‚Äôt mean they should be overlooked. While I agree men shouldn‚Äôt be allowed in women‚Äôs bathrooms, there are solutions that would work for both sides of the issue, such as unisex bathrooms. However, it appears people would rather keep the fight going than come to any sort of compromise.
The tensions between those on both sides of this issue are extremely high, and it appears they will stay that way for some time.
When are we going to stop treating each other as less than human, and start realizing we‚Äôre all human beings? We all have the same feelings and the same rights. We should be working together to better our community for all of us rather than seeking to negatively affect those with whom we disagree.
No one group has the right to trample on the rights of others.
This works both ways. It‚Äôs only by coming together and finding a solution that works for both sides that these issues, and the animosity associated with them, will die down.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,477,62.47,55.05,41.82,9.98,19.88,20.96,88.68,68.97,55.35,12.58,4.4,0.42,1.47,0,0,2.31,8.18,18.03,5.45,0.63,15.51,8.6,4.19,6.71,1.26,16.77,6.92,5.66,7.13,2.52,1.68,2.94,18.03,1.68,16.35,2.73,1.47,2.52,2.52,0.63,5.87,0,5.66,2.31,3.35,1.26,0.21,1.05,0.84,0.21,0,0,12.16,4.19,0.63,0,1.89,0.63,0.21,8.6,0,0,1.26,0.63,1.68,1.68,0,0,1.26,0,0,1.05,0.21,0,1.68,0,0,0,0,0,0.84,0.21,0.21,0.42,0,0.21,0,0,0,0.21,0.84,0,5.24,9.43,0.84,1.68,5.03,1.05,0,1.26,3.77,3.35,3.98,2.73,0.21,0,0.21,0,0,12.79,4.82,5.24,0.21,0,1.68,0.84,0,0.21,0,0.42,0.42,0,3.96,3.94,3.48,3.38,3.32,-3.59,-2.2,-1.02,-2.13,-2.23,0.21,0.63,0.21,0.84,0.84,0.21,1.05,0,0.21,0,0,0.84,0.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.11,1.73,18.18,146.75,0.63,335.43,0,125.79,1.05,230.61,0.42,146.75,-1.05,188.68,-0.21,314.47,0,83.86,0.63,0,0,0,0,62.89,20.96,251.57,83.86,20.96,230.61,0.84,230.61,209.64,20.96,20.96,0,0,0,125.79,0,230.61,83.86,62.89,0,1.89,1,0.21,0.62,0,0.21,0,0,0.82,0,0.21,0,0.21,0.21,1

A La Marque man convicted of sexually assaulting a young girl skipped town after being allowed to stay out on bond on Thursday.
Billy Wayne Atwood Jr., 37, was taken into custody and was being held in the Liberty County Jail, a jail official confirmed Saturday. Atwood went missing Friday after failing to appear in court for sentencing. During his absence, the jury sentenced him to life in prison, according to the Galveston County District Attorney‚Äôs Office. Prosecutors had requested Atwood, who was free on bond, be booked into jail after being found guilty. Judge David Garner denied the request.
Michael A. Smith: It‚Äôs easy to second guess the judge on this one. But he was obligated to walk a fine line between conflicting demands ‚Äî the need to keep the convicted incarcerated and the constitutional right to bond.

The Bad: Motorcycle fatalities
The overall number of crashes involving motorcycles in Galveston County is down compared to past years, but accidents resulting in fatalities and incapacitating injuries remain consistent, according to the Texas Department of Transportation.
That was good news as the 14th annual Lone Star Rally rolled into town. But the good news didn‚Äôt last long. A motorcycle crash on Thursday left a Seabrook man dead and his wife critically injured. No other deaths have been reported as of Saturday. And while the decline in the overall number is positive, University of Texas at Austin Professor Kara Kockelman reminded us that there is still work to be done in reducing serious crashes.
Smith: Given the weather, it‚Äôs noteworthy that there were so few bad accidents this year.
Worner: Riders should always wear a helmet, never drink and ride and take a motorcycle safety course every couple of years. Even experienced riders can use a safety reminder from time to time. In fact, they need it more because as you become comfortable with riding there is a tendency to become overconfident.
The Ugly:
Houston Equal Rights Ordinance defeat
On Tuesday voters in Houston soundly rejected the city‚Äôs equal rights ordinance in a heated political contest that caught the attention of the nation and sparked impassioned debate about social issues, especially rights for gay and transgender individuals. The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Smith: It‚Äôs clear that voters in Houston weren‚Äôt ready for everything the ordinance proposed. Supporters should recall that progress is a process, scale the law back some and take another run at it.
  Worner: Once again the opposition played the fear card and they did a mighty good job at it. They turned the whole debate into pedophiles having access to little girls in the restroom. Give me a break. It‚Äôs time that we stop discriminating because we can‚Äôt be bothered with trying to understand an alternative lifestyle.

11/9/15,19,City Hall,"Tomorrow, Dallas council will vote on adding 'gender identity and expression' protections ","A proposal to add ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù to the city of Dallas‚Äô anti-discrimination ordinance stirred concern at City Hall this morning.
Supporters, led by council member Adam Medrano, said the proposed change to the city‚Äôs law was just some much-needed paperwork ‚Äî ‚Äúclean-up language‚Äù to clarify the protections the city already offers.
In a memo to colleagues late Friday, Medrano wrote that amending the existing ordinance would show that ‚Äúa person‚Äôs gender is determined by the person‚Äôs own perception of their gender.‚Äù And it would make it illegal to deny housing to someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The proposed rewrite also erases an exemption that previously said property owners could deny renting rooms ‚Äúto persons of the same sex when the dwelling contains common lavatory, kitchen or similar facilities available for the use of all persons occupying the dwelling.‚Äù
Per Dallas City Attorney Warren Ernst, Chapter 46 of the Dallas City Code has defined sexual orientation to include ‚Äúreal or perceived gender identity‚Äù since it was first enacted in 2002.
Council member Rick Callahan, of Pleasant Grove, wasn‚Äôt prepared to sign off on the amendment without discussion.
He said he‚Äôd been out of town at National League of Cities in Nashville (where he said he was running for a board position), just got back in town last night, and hadn‚Äôt had time to read the memo. Said Callahan, he‚Äôs been ‚Äúextremely busy‚Äù and, well, adding this to council‚Äôs voting agenda tomorrow is ‚Äúunfair to the committee and the council.‚Äù
Quality of Life chair Sandy Greyson and two city attorneys told Callahan this isn‚Äôt a change to existing rules, merely a better definition. Said Greyson, adding ‚Äúgender identity and expression‚Äù is merely a ‚Äúfurther explanation of what sexual orientation means.‚Äù
But as we learned in Houston last week, where the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was defeated by voters after it was reduced to the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù by opponents, semantic disputes are often the ugliest.
After nearly 45 minutes behind closed doors, there was no further discussion: Philip Kingston motioned sending the amendment, there was a second and the matter was sent along to the full council for a vote tomorrow.

11/8/15,19,News,Kernels of thought on building wealth ,"Dear Editor:
A farmer gave me the philosophy of the corn on how people get rich in America. A kernel of corn is planted into the ground, where it grows and produces an ear that has a hundred kernels on it. Some kernels are used but others are saved and planted. How many kernels that are saved and planted could give you a thousand kernels?
This philosophy can be seen with immigrants that come to the United States. Many work hard to have an existence living but invest in leaving their children in a better situation than they were by educating them, creating a business or asset that they can use to build wealth. Those children become the middle class. If those children use the same philosophy as their parents their children will become the rich in America. It is very seldom that in one generation you become rich.
An example are the boat people of Vietnam. They came to the Unites States and many settled in New Orleans.
For about 15 years they worked in the hot sun of New Orleans mowing grass and any menial jobs. They invested their time and money educating their kids. Those children now are lawyers, doctors and business owners and have become wealthy. They take care of the parents. They became wealthy in two generations because of planning and investing.
If any generation decides to use up all of the assets the net generation must start over again with existence living and trying to give something to their children to use as seed money to improve their existence. If each generation uses up all of their assets they will be trapped in existence living.
The Obama administration and most Democratic legislators want to take away the seed money by supporting the death taxes. This money could be placed into improving people‚Äôs lives who work hard and plan for the future. The policies that they have in place now give the incentive to spend it all until everyone is back to existence living. We pay taxes all of our lives and now they wish to tax us when we are dead. If this tax is not removed the philosophy of the corn will cease to exist.
If we continue to believe in the Democratic policies and their taking of wealth to create equity and fairness in a couple of more generations everyone will be equally poor.
Outrageous federal intrusion into locker room Harold Horstmann Lohman
Dear Editor:
A Nov. 3 article by Ben Shipiro: ‚ÄúFeds Rule to Force High School Girls to Undress Next to Naked Boys Who Think They‚Äôre Girls‚Äù ( www.breitbart.www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/03/feds-ruleforce- high-school-girls-undress-next-naked-boys-think- theyre-girls/).
Quotes from the article: ‚ÄúOn Monday, the federal government declared itself fit for the madhouse by mandating that a Chicago high school allow a full biological male into the girls‚Äô locker room for all purposes, including nudity. This biological male, the feds determined, was different because he thinks he is a female.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe U.S. Department of Education‚Äôs Office for Civil Rights spent almost two years checking out the Township High School District 211 because of the transgender ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù He filed a complaint with the feds in 2013 after the school refused ‚Äúunrestricted access‚Äù to the girls‚Äô locker room. The district eventually agreed to allow the boy into the girls‚Äô room so long as he used a privacy curtain while disrobing.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt good enough. The feds determined that this still constituted discrimination.
‚ÄúWhy? As John Knight, director of the alphabet-soup LGBT and AIDS Project at the ACLU, stated, this was ‚Äúblatant discrimination.‚Äù Perhaps the district does not see ‚Äúher‚Äù as a ‚Äúgirl‚Äù because ‚Äúshe‚Äù is not a she, a her, or a girl. Nonetheless, the Office for Civil Rights agreed, with Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Catherine Lhamon averring: All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities ‚Äî this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls‚Äô locker room.‚Äù
The following article provides a glimmer of hope at least until Obama‚Äôs Justice Dept. takes over our schools like they have our police departments. A quote from a Nov. 3 article by Katherine Driessen:
‚ÄúHouston Equal Rights Ordinance fails by wide margin‚Äù ( www.chron.com/politics/election/local/article/HERO-results-6608562.). ‚ÄúThe hotly contested election has spurred national attention, drawing comment from the White House and the state‚Äôs top officials.

11/8/15,19,B,"Commentary - Before the next vote, pro-HERO folks need their own slogan ","Read more from this award-winning columnist at HoustonChronicle.com/Falkenberg
Two days after Houston's HERO went down in flames at the polls, I found myself at an education nonprofit fundraiser, where I had just given a speech, talking to a man who had opposed the city's equal rights ordinance.
He seemed to be a nice guy - educated, compassionate. He didn't give off any homophobic vibes. He said he believed the ordinance was unnecessary since it covered people who already enjoyed federal anti-discrimination protections.
I said something like, ""So, I guess you didn't buy that whole argument that you shouldn't have to file an expensive, lengthy federal lawsuit to fight discrimination?""
He paused for a second.
""I hadn't heard that argument,"" he said.
The moment solidified my feeling that, despite national perceptions of Houston after the vote, HERO didn't fail because a large share of us hate gay and transgender people, to whom the ordinance extended protections.
That may be the reason people like Dr. Steven Hotze launched the anti-HERO ""Campaign for Houston,"" just as he did the ""straight slate"" 30 years before. His motivation is fighting the ""cesspools"" of homosexuality, or the ""homo-fascists,"" as he calls gay rights advocates.
He and his ilk are always thirsting for the next battle in the culture wars. And they won one with HERO. It helped that only 27 percent of registered Houston voters cast ballots.
There are plenty of theories for why the pro-HERO group Houston Unites failed to defend the ordinance: it didn't have enough time to rally its base. Annise Parker, Houston's first openly gay mayor, became the face of HERO, thereby keeping the focus on gay rights rather than the rights of everybody.
Then, of course, rather than answering their opponents' ugliness with more ugliness, HERO advocates mostly took the high road in TV ads. The high road led to a dead end.
""The morning after, I was wishing we'd run one that said 'lie, lie, lie!' "" said Terri Burke, director of the ACLU of Texas. The biggest problem was messaging.
The anti-HERO folks seized on the most vulnerable part of the ordinance - the fact that it protected transgender Houstonians' right to use the public bathroom of their choice - and didn't let go.
""They took that small zone of discomfort, magnified it 100 times, and focused all their energy on that part of the ordinance,"" said Mark Jones, political science professor at Rice University.
They took an asinine, misleading phrase and repeated it over and over: ""No men in women's bathrooms."" 'Effective' lies
It was so stupid, it was brilliant.
Jones likened it to the tactic used by social conservatives in their battle to limit abortion access to Texas women. They repeat incessantly that the restrictive laws aren't really about reducing abortion; they're about ""protecting women's health.""
That claim is untrue, too, as nonpartisan medical experts have testified. I asked Jones if lies have become acceptable in politics as long as you repeat them enough.
""It definitely was effective,"" Jones said of the anti-HERO campaign, and left it at that.
Then I got to thinking. Why can't equality be simple, too? Why can't an ordinance that really was about American values - freedom from discrimination for 15 different groups of Houstonians - be boiled down to one catchy phrase?
Considering we'll be back at the drawing board next year with a new mayor and a new ordinance, I'll leave you with a few slogans supporters can repeat until they're blue in the face or until voters understand what the damn thing does - whichever comes sooner.
""It's about the Super Bowl, not the toilet bowl!""
Houston is the largest city in the country without a comprehensive anti-discrimination ordinance. That distinction undermines our ""world-class"" status and suggests we're nothing more than a backwater town. As the folks at the Greater Houston Partnership understood when they endorsed HERO, we need it to compete for conventions, corporate relocations, and, yes, major sporting events.
""Bigotry is bad for business.""
Anybody disagree?
""Kick the feds out of our bathrooms!""
Go ahead! Tap into that anti-Washington fervor. Why force Houstonians with discrimination claims to make their cases in federal court? We're Texans. We don't need the feds to settle our disputes.
""Keep bathroom stalking illegal!""
True motivations
Nothing about the HERO ordinance changed a decades-old ordinance banning anyone from entering a restroom to disturb others.
""Make #BlackLivesMatter even more.""
During the brief time HERO was in effect, city officials say most of the claims involved racial discrimination.
Here's another good one - ""We just need to pee."" That's a recent rallying cry of transgender Americans that went viral on Twitter and pretty much sums up their true motivations here.

11/8/15,19,B,"Commentary - Before the next vote, pro-HERO folks need their own slogan ","
Two days after Houston's HERO went down in flames at the polls, I found myself at an education nonprofit fundraiser, where I had just given a speech, talking to a man who had opposed the city's equal rights ordinance.
He seemed to be a nice guy - educated, compassionate. He didn't give off any homophobic vibes. He said he believed the ordinance was unnecessary since it covered people who already enjoyed federal anti-discrimination protections.
I said something like, ""So, I guess you didn't buy that whole argument that you shouldn't have to file an expensive, lengthy federal lawsuit to fight discrimination?""
He paused for a second.
""I hadn't heard that argument,"" he said.
The moment solidified my feeling that, despite national perceptions of Houston after the vote, HERO didn't fail because a large share of us hate gay and transgender people, to whom the ordinance extended protections.
That may be the reason people like Dr. Steven Hotze launched the anti-HERO ""Campaign for Houston,"" just as he did the ""straight slate"" 30 years before. His motivation is fighting the ""cesspools"" of homosexuality, or the ""homo-fascists,"" as he calls gay rights advocates.
He and his ilk are always thirsting for the next battle in the culture wars. And they won one with HERO. It helped that only 27 percent of registered Houston voters cast ballots.
There are plenty of theories for why the pro-HERO group Houston Unites failed to defend the ordinance: it didn't have enough time to rally its base. Annise Parker, Houston's first openly gay mayor, became the face of HERO, thereby keeping the focus on gay rights rather than the rights of everybody.
Then, of course, rather than answering their opponents' ugliness with more ugliness, HERO advocates mostly took the high road in TV ads. The high road led to a dead end.
""The morning after, I was wishing we'd run one that said 'lie, lie, lie!' "" said Terri Burke, director of the ACLU of Texas. The biggest problem was messaging.
The anti-HERO folks seized on the most vulnerable part of the ordinance - the fact that it protected transgender Houstonians' right to use the public bathroom of their choice - and didn't let go.
""They took that small zone of discomfort, magnified it 100 times, and focused all their energy on that part of the ordinance,"" said Mark Jones, political science professor at Rice University.
They took an asinine, misleading phrase and repeated it over and over: ""No men in women's bathrooms."" 'Effective' lies
It was so stupid, it was brilliant.
Jones likened it to the tactic used by social conservatives in their battle to limit abortion access to Texas women. They repeat incessantly that the restrictive laws aren't really about reducing abortion; they're about ""protecting women's health.""
That claim is untrue, too, as nonpartisan medical experts have testified. I asked Jones if lies have become acceptable in politics as long as you repeat them enough.
""It definitely was effective,"" Jones said of the anti-HERO campaign, and left it at that.
Then I got to thinking. Why can't equality be simple, too? Why can't an ordinance that really was about American values - freedom from discrimination for 15 different groups of Houstonians - be boiled down to one catchy phrase?
Considering we'll be back at the drawing board next year with a new mayor and a new ordinance, I'll leave you with a few slogans supporters can repeat until they're blue in the face or until voters understand what the damn thing does - whichever comes sooner.
""It's about the Super Bowl, not the toilet bowl!""
Houston is the largest city in the country without a comprehensive anti-discrimination ordinance. That distinction undermines our ""world-class"" status and suggests we're nothing more than a backwater town. As the folks at the Greater Houston Partnership understood when they endorsed HERO, we need it to compete for conventions, corporate relocations, and, yes, major sporting events.
""Bigotry is bad for business.""
Anybody disagree?
""Kick the feds out of our bathrooms!""
Go ahead! Tap into that anti-Washington fervor. Why force Houstonians with discrimination claims to make their cases in federal court? We're Texans. We don't need the feds to settle our disputes.
""Keep bathroom stalking illegal!""
True motivations
Nothing about the HERO ordinance changed a decades-old ordinance banning anyone from entering a restroom to disturb others.
""Make #BlackLivesMatter even more.""
During the brief time HERO was in effect, city officials say most of the claims involved racial discrimination.
Here's another good one - ""We just need to pee."" That's a recent rallying cry of transgender Americans that went viral on Twitter and pretty much sums up their true motivations here.
It's been a long, painful campaign. But another campaign for another version of the ordinance is around the corner. It will be led by our new mayor, to be decided in a runoff between Sylvester Turner and Bill King.

11/7/15,19,Opinion,"OUR VIEWPOINT: HERO results shouldn't be seen as indictment of lifestyle, but as win for fear ","The defeat of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance at the polls this week was more a victory for fear-mongering than a win for so- called traditional values.
Those who see it as an affront to their personal lifestyles and those who see it as support of their disdain of those both probably are wrong.
That‚Äôs because it will never be clear how many people voted against the HERO proposal out of fear that it would literally open the door for sexual predators to enter women‚Äôs bathrooms and molest our girls. A months-long campaign highlighting the potential use of public restrooms by transgender men and women, and a correlation that would allow more sexual predators into women‚Äôs restrooms, saw to that.
Of course, the referendum was about so much more than restrooms.
Supporters of the ordinance had said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Those who opposed it, however, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality.
The way we see it, the results of Tuesday‚Äôs election did not indicate whether voters believe someone‚Äôs right to non-discrimination protection should usurp another‚Äôs beliefs regarding homosexuality.
Rather, they showed the power of a calculated campaign that plays on our worst fears.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,225,75.27,75.36,4.71,5.54,25,28.89,91.56,65.78,52.44,12.89,4.44,0,1.33,0,0,1.78,8.44,17.78,8,0,15.56,5.78,4,7.56,0.89,12.44,7.11,5.33,8.89,2.22,0.89,6.22,14.22,0.44,13.33,1.78,3.11,1.78,1.78,0.89,4,0,8,3.11,4.89,1.78,0,1.78,0.89,0.89,0,0,16.44,7.56,1.33,0.89,1.33,1.33,1.33,9.78,0,0,1.78,0.44,3.11,3.11,0,0,1.78,0.44,0,0,0,1.33,3.56,0,0,0,0,0,2.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.44,1.78,0,4,5.33,0.44,0.44,2.22,2.22,0,0,2.22,4.89,0.89,1.33,0,0,0,0,0,13.78,4,5.33,0,0,2.67,1.78,0,0.44,0.44,0.89,0.44,0,4.02,4.01,3.44,3.57,3.69,-3.41,-1.38,0.15,-0.78,-2,0,0.89,0,0.44,0.89,0.44,0.44,0,0.89,0,0.89,0.89,0.44,0.44,0.44,0.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,2.3,19.11,88.89,0.89,488.89,-1.33,177.78,1.33,133.33,0.44,88.89,0,266.67,0.44,177.78,0,222.22,0.89,88.89,0.89,88.89,0,0,44.44,133.33,0,0,88.89,0.44,133.33,133.33,44.44,0,0,0,0,400,0,88.89,133.33,0,0,1.78,1,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,0,0.87,0,0.43,0.43,0.87,0,1
11/7/15,19,B,Garcia backs Turner for runoff - Third-place finisher asks Latinos to 'stay at the table' in mayoral race ,"
Standing next to his rival of just a few days ago, Adrian Garcia on Friday publicly threw his support behind Sylvester Turner's mayoral bid as it heads toward a December runoff.
Garcia, who finished third in Houston's mayoral race Tuesday, asked the Latino community to ""stay at the table"" and support Turner. Collectively, the two of them received almost half of all votes - 49 percent - cast for mayor.
As the first-place finisher Tuesday, Turner faces businessman and former Kemah mayor Bill King in a December runoff. The runoff is expected to be around Dec. 12, but cannot be set until last Tuesday's vote is canvassed.
""Our beginnings get us to this point where it makes sense that my goal, my vision for the city as a candidate for the mayor of Houston is now to be manifested in Sylvester's campaign,"" Garcia said at Turner's campaign headquarters in southwest Houston.
Garcia, who left his job as Harris County sheriff to run for mayor, pledged his support to Turner, saying he would volunteer, knock on doors and make phone calls for the 25-year state representative making his third attempt at the mayor's office.
Asked if his endorsement could lead to a position in a Turner administration, Garcia answered that ""nothing was asked; nothing was promised.""
Citing their similarities growing up in Houston from humble beginnings, Turner said he is depending on Garcia to help him move the city forward.
'Political juggernaut'
""There's no question about the contribution he has made to the city and made to this county,"" Turner said. ""I'm extremely gratified for him to be standing with me, having been in the mayor's race together. To help move this city forward, and to join not just a campaign, but to join in making sure we do everything possible to create a city whose future will be brighter than its past, that will be respectful for everyone, where every neighborhood will have value and meaning.""
Friday's announcement is expected to help both men, local observers said.
It can help Turner court Latino voters who may not otherwise turnout for a runoff election, said Michael Adams, political science professor at Texas Southern University.
In fact, he said, it could signal the start of a ""black and brown"" coalition of African-American and Hispanic voters that could become ""a political juggernaut.""
At the same time, Adams said, the endorsement can help Garcia regain credibility and support among Democrats upset at his decision to resign his sheriff's post, where he was the highest ranking elected Democrat in Harris County, to run for mayor.
His endorsement of Turner will help ""boost his chances of running again, and winning a partisan office,"" Adams said.
As Rice University political science Professor Mark Jones put it, ""He has aligned himself with someone, if victorious on Dec. 12, who will be most influential Democrat in Harris County."" For Turner, the endorsement further ""solidifies his status as the Democratic Party's candidate, without question,"" Jones said.
That enables Turner to define the election in partisan terms, identifying second-place finisher King as a Republican in a city where Democrats outnumber the GOP almost two to one, he said. Houston municipal races officially are non-partisan.
Rights law's impact
Jones said King is likely to want the runoff to remain a nonpartisan race, which could put him in the unusual position of insisting the race is not about party while signaling to social conservatives who came out to vote against the Houston equal rights ordinance on Tuesday to come back next month to cast another vote for him.
King's campaign had no comment on Garcia's endorsement. King spokesman Jim McGrath said his candidate had not yet received endorsements from the other candidates in Tuesday's elections, but had heard from supporters of some of his rivals who expressed interest in his campaign.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,636,85.65,71.02,22.7,78.39,24.46,25.31,83.33,58.65,46.54,9.59,6.6,0.63,0.47,0,4.09,0.31,2.99,13.05,6.45,1.42,15.88,6.76,2.99,4.09,1.42,14.31,4.56,2.67,9.43,2.99,1.57,5.35,10.38,1.26,9.12,1.26,1.42,1.57,2.04,0.31,3.3,0,4.4,4.09,0.31,0.31,0.16,0.16,0,0,0.16,0,19.81,8.81,3.14,0.16,0.31,0,3.62,10.22,0,0,0,5.19,7.08,6.29,0.63,0.16,2.2,0.31,0.16,1.73,0.16,0,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0.16,0.63,0,0.16,0,0.31,0,0.63,2.2,11.32,0.47,1.73,8.33,0.63,0.16,0.16,4.4,5.35,2.67,1.42,0,0,0,0,0,17.77,4.09,6.45,0,0,2.83,4.4,0,1.1,0,0,0,0,2.7,2.58,2.88,2.84,2.13,-2.13,-0.1,1.14,0.48,-0.51,0.31,1.1,0.94,0,0.47,0,0.79,0,0.31,0,0,0,0.31,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.83,0.81,23.31,314.47,2.83,267.3,0.16,188.68,1.57,220.13,2.2,62.89,-0.63,455.97,1.57,691.82,0,408.81,-0.31,15.72,0.16,15.72,0,110.06,188.68,78.62,0,15.72,78.62,-0.31,141.51,62.89,94.34,31.45,0,0,0,141.51,0,125.79,0,31.45,0,0.16,1,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
11/7/15,19,News,Liberals losing the culture wars ,"The libertine left has done a lot of boasting over the last several years about the inevitability of History vanquishing every corner of American social conservatism. Election Day 2015 was a terrible day for these revolutionaries, as so often it is when it‚Äôs the American people, not liberal elites, making the decisions.
Let‚Äôs assess the damage:
--In Kentucky, incoming Republican governor Matt Bevin won despite proudly embracing the cause of country clerk Kim Davis, a clear rebuke to the cultural let‚Äôs agenda to impose gay ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù on every conservative Christian jurisdiction.
--In Virginia, two GOP state senate candidates were targeted by liberal billionaire Michael Bloomberg‚Äôs group ‚ÄúEverytown for Gun Safety.‚Äù One won and one lost, leaving the state senate in Republican hands.
--The city of Houston thumped outgoing lesbian leftist mayor Annise Parker by voting overwhelmingly (61 to 39 percent) to refuse the ‚ÄúHERO‚Äù --Houston Equal Rights Ordinance --a 31-page packet of mumbo-jumbo that among other things would have fined businesses up to $5,000 for refusing to allow men who ‚Äúidentify‚Äù as women from using the women‚Äôs restrooms.
--Ohio rejected marijuana legalization by a 2-1 margin. ‚ÄúIssue 3‚Äù would have legalized recreational marijuana for anyone over 21, and in medicinal form for those of any age with a doctor‚Äôs note. Some ‚Äúprogressives‚Äù didn‚Äôt like a provision allowing a growers‚Äô monopoly system for the first four years.
--Even in ultraliberal San Francisco, the sheriff who steadfastly defended the city‚Äôs outrageous ‚Äúsanctuary city‚Äù policy after Kate Steinle was murdered by an immigrant here illegally, went down to defeat.
One journalist is analyzing the elections correctly (for the most part) and it‚Äôs noteworthy it comes out of The Atlantic, clearly a liberal venue.
In her article ‚ÄúLiberals Are Losing the Culture Wars,‚Äù Molly Ball acknowledges that the left can attempt to diminish the results by saying this was ‚Äúan off-off-year election with dismally low voter turnout, waged in just a handful of locales. But liberals who cite this as an explanation often fail to take the next step and ask why the most consistent voters are consistently hostile to their views, or why liberal social positions don‚Äôt mobilize infrequent voters.‚Äù
There is clearly a ‚Äúpassion gap‚Äù between the secular left and the religious right. The conservatives are mobilizing, spurred by an increasing liberal authoritarianism since the last presidential election, as the left puts ‚Äúreligious liberty‚Äù in scare quotes.
Ball offers an analysis far outside the liberal media‚Äôs conventional ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù that the Republican Party is fractured between the religious right determined to commit political suicide with their ancient positions and a country-club establishment that understands it‚Äôs time to surrender.
Ball said GOP divisions show ‚Äúan ideologically flexible big-tent party, while Democrats are in lockstep around an agenda whose popularity they too often fail to question.‚Äù Democrats want to believe Americans completely share with their radical vision of social change, but end up losing elections.
There‚Äôs a reason liberals always think they‚Äôre winning. It‚Äôs because in both ‚Äúnews‚Äù reporting and entertainment propaganda, they incessantly evangelize for gun safety, marriage equality, legalized marijuana, transgender civil rights protections and untrammeled amnesty for illegal immigrants as if only the leftist position is acceptable. The only days they get a reality check are election days. L. Brent Bozell III is the president of the Media Research Center.

11/6/15,19,Opinion,John McCroskey Commentary: King County Likely Will Bail Out Pro-Tax Folks ,"Now that the election is over, but before it is even certified, a group is considering suing us ‚Äî again ‚Äî because we the voters voted to make it harder for Olympia to raise taxes, and if they don‚Äôt, to reduce the sales tax.
I‚Äôm not really sure why they are so concerned at this point. After all, the votes in King County haven‚Äôt been counted, or even been found yet.
We know from history King County can find the necessary votes, and the state recount as many times as it takes, to snatch victory from the rest of us. And unlike the rest of the state, which only find votes in secure places, in King County they can find them everywhere.
Those very thorough vote counters up there leave no stone unturned and once they know how many they need, they‚Äôll find them.
But in the unlikely event they do have to go to court, our justices have already ruled against voters and for the Democrats who sued us before.
If I were betting, I‚Äôd bet they will again.
Sen. David Frockt, D-Seattle, was part of one of those earlier lawsuits against voters and is worried about the pickle they (the Legislature) will be in if this voter mandate holds.
On the one hand, the Legislature can‚Äôt prioritize spending and find any wasteful programs to cut, while on the other, the courts intruded into the legislative branch and demanded they spend more on ‚Äúbasic‚Äù education.
And in between are the voters, who too often can‚Äôt win regardless of their votes. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
Few issues over the years have confused me more than the suddenly popular notion of self-identification of your gender. Are you male, female, either, neither or both? I‚Äôve lost count how many different versions of man and woman there are today but read where Facebook recognizes 51.
And while that confuses me, the part that bothers me most was the sudden government-sanctioned advocacy for a man who identifies as a woman being allowed, by law, to use the women‚Äôs restroom or shower. Or ladies in the men‚Äôs room, for that matter, and all this is being done in the name of equal rights.
What‚Äôs equal about allowing men in the girls‚Äô restroom? Just doesn‚Äôt seem equal for the girls in there who might be uncomfortable about this.
In Houston, after the city mayor and council proposed what they called the HERO (Houston Equal Rights Ordinance) the voters by a 61-39 percent majority rejected the idea.
Not because they are mean, but because common sense tells most people this is a bad idea.
Of course, proponents argue it‚Äôs only fair to let this happen and to be able to claim discrimination if anyone objects, and vilify anyone who disagreed. But for now, at least in Houston, those voters didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea either. ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢
This week, the Sheriff‚Äôs Office is gearing up for the annual Shop With a Cop. It‚Äôs hard to believe it‚Äôs been going on for 14 years. Many good people and Walmart folks have helped this program make Christmas better for some needy kids and families.
But as I recall, it started with the idea of a young deputy, now Chief Deputy, Stacy Brown.
Folks here bought so many doughnuts that first year we needed a big truck to get them to Walmart for delivery. The cops and doughnuts stereotype really worked to our advantage.
I can‚Äôt recall how I chose Rose‚Äôs Furniture owner Roger Rose and convinced him (really didn‚Äôt take much convincing) it would be a good idea to drive his delivery truck up to the Krispy Kreme store (in the middle of the night) to get them, but he did.

11/6/15,19,B,"Equal rights measure not dead, mayor says - Parker says she will fight for protections until leaving office ","After the failure of her nondiscrimination ordinance at the ballot box, Mayor Annise Parker said she may try to pass similar or related protections before leaving office at the end of the year.
Some of the 10 council members who voted with her in passing the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance in 2014, she said, have suggested bringing the protections in segments, such as banning discrimination in employment, then housing, then public accommodations. But Parker said she has no set plan and must speak with council members.
""I'm going to sit down with the council members and see how they want to proceed,"" Parker said. ""We will also, of course, evaluate what the national and international response from the business community is, because that certainly will make a difference.""
Parker said she had received calls from business interests given pause by the ordinance's rejection but refused to elaborate.
""You may have noticed that I'm trying to clear as many things off my desk as possible. I don't really want to leave a whole lot of contentious items for the next administration,"" Parker said. ""I'm going to try not to leave this one, as well. I think we have a responsibility to try to be thoughtful and figure out a way to bring those protections back.""
'Walk away from it'
Councilwoman Ellen Cohen, who whipped votes for the item on council, said a proposal could come back before the December runoff elections for mayor, controller and for seven council seats, after those contests are decided, or in January, when a new mayor takes over for term-limited Parker.
The equal rights ordinance, known by its acronym HERO, would have extended local protections against discrimination to 15 groups, ranging from veterans to pregnant women to gay and transgender residents, with the latter proving the biggest flashpoint for conservative opponents of the law.
Critics pinned their campaign on the controversial claim that the law would allow men dressed as women, including sexual predators, to enter women's restrooms. Opponents' most talked-about ad featured a man bursting into a bathroom stall occupied by a young girl as ominous music played in the background.
Councilman Dave Martin, who opposed the ordinance, said the strong opinions generated by the campaign make it illogical to reintroduce the law this year, particularly for the four incumbent council members facing runoffs.
""To talk about bringing it back this year doesn't sit well with me because it's almost like a slap in the face to the voters who overwhelmingly decided that HERO was not an ordinance they wanted to have within the city of Houston at this point in time,"" Martin said. ""I think you have to walk away from it a little while letting the emotions die down and then maybe look at this under a new administration.""
Cohen said the options of what precisely to bring back could, in theory, resemble closely the ordinance that was rejected, could mirror some other cities' wording to exempt bathrooms, locker rooms and shower facilities from coverage under the ""public accommodations"" section of the ordinance, or could come piecemeal, as Parker discussed.
Too soon to revive? Parker stressed that any proposal she brings forward will include all 15 protected classes - including transgender residents - and said she is not interested in advancing a measure that exempts changing rooms or related areas.
University of Houston political scientist Richard Murray said it may be politically difficult for Parker to reintroduce the item, noting that the mayor pulled off an unfortunate and unusual ""hat trick"" by uniting three of Houston's four voting blocks (blacks, Hispanics and conservative whites) against the proposition. The ballot measure gained only the support of liberal whites; of the city's 11 council districts, only progressive, urban District C voted yes.
""This mayor has expended so much of her political capital on this and basically come up empty,"" Murray said. ""For her - having lost an election decisively - to try to bring it back, opponents would be suspicious and leery and saying, 'The voters have spoken; you lost, move on.' ""
'Gaping budget hole'
That does not mean Houston long will go without a nondiscrimination ordinance on the books, he said.
""Whoever wins the runoff will be under an awful lot of pressure to pass a fairly comprehensive nondiscrimination ordinance because just about everybody else has it, and it can be used against you in competing for events,"" Murray said. ""The next mayor will sure as hell want to get this issue out of the way and get on the heavy lifting that really can't be avoided: the gaping budget hole they're going to have to confront.""
Houston faces a projected $126 million deficit for the budget year that starts next July.
""I think Houston will at some point be where we need to be,"" Cohen said. ""The question is how do we get there? How do we get a message of fairness across, and when do we do it and how do we do it? People may need some breathing time. We have to talk about it.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,840,85.48,58.49,32.35,13.81,25.45,23.81,86.43,66.31,50.6,9.4,4.88,1.07,0.95,0.48,1.31,0.48,4.52,14.05,8.33,1.43,16.19,7.38,3.81,5.6,0.95,18.57,5.48,3.33,5.71,1.55,1.19,3.1,12.26,0.48,11.79,3.1,1.79,2.5,2.02,0.95,2.98,0,3.69,1.43,2.02,0.71,0,0.6,0.36,0,0,0.12,13.93,6.07,0.12,0,0.95,0.36,3.1,6.79,0.12,0,1.67,0.36,2.86,2.74,0.12,0,4.17,0.24,0.71,2.74,0.6,0.12,1.07,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0.12,1.07,0.48,0.83,0.24,0,0,0.12,0.95,0.48,5.6,10,0.6,2.5,6.79,0.48,0.12,0.12,2.98,4.29,2.26,3.21,0.12,0,0.12,0,0,16.67,3.57,5.6,0.36,0,2.38,4.76,0,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,3.24,3.5,3.2,3.3,2.67,-3.1,-1.84,-0.83,-0.9,-1.95,0.12,0.36,0,0.12,0.95,0.24,0.36,0,0.24,0.12,0,0.24,0.71,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.81,1.97,17.41,178.57,1.19,190.48,-0.12,166.67,1.43,238.1,2.26,142.86,-0.95,261.9,-1.55,333.33,0,202.38,-0.24,23.81,0.24,0,0,35.71,35.71,95.24,23.81,11.9,95.24,0,190.48,95.24,11.9,95.24,11.9,0.12,0,130.95,35.71,154.76,59.52,11.9,47.62,0.6,1,0.24,0.71,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.24,0.12,0.24,0,1
11/6/15,19,A,"Some local restrooms outpace politics - Restaurants, UH Downtown offer unisex facilities shared by everyone ","Another attempt
Mayor says she may try to pass protections before leaving office. Page B1 The restroom of the future is taking shape before our eyes.
At The Pass & Provisions restaurant, men and women share a common wash station surrounded by five private stalls. The University of Houston-Downtown uses a restroom sign that shows a traditional male stick figure, a female stick figure, a figure that combines the two, and a wheelchair.
There's even an app that helps transgender people find safe facilities.
Three days ago, the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance went down in defeat, in what opponents dubbed the ""bathroom ordinance."" Although voters expressed considerable unease at the thought of a transgender woman in a woman's bathroom, Houston restrooms are way ahead of politics.
No Houston establishments are required by law to offer unisex bathrooms, yet some already do. Restaurants, universities and businesses have found creative solutions to an issue that has pushed its way to the forefront in national conversations about discrimination in general, and gay and transgender rights, specifically.
As other cities across the country approve ordinances requiring unisex, single-occupancy restrooms - Austin and Santa Fe, N.M., among them - the writing on the wall couldn't be clearer. The restroom signage might say All Gender, Gender Neutral, Unisex, or something more whimsical. The signage might say nothing at all, offering an image to explain what words cannot.
80-year-old ladies and Texans
At North Italia restaurant on Post Oak, three of the five private restrooms are marked Either/Or.
At The Pass & Provisions, two restaurants under one roof in the Fourth Ward, ""We've had little 80-year-old ladies washing their hands next to Texans players,"" said chef/owner Seth Siegel-Gardner.
Two of the stalls are labeled ""Men"" and three are labeled ""Women,"" Siegel-Gardner said, but ""they're marked with chalk, so I guess they're all optional."" The restrooms weren't designed with gender or politics in mind; it was just the arrangement that ""made the most sense, design-wise.""
""No one has ever complained to me about it,"" Siegel-Gardner added, but there's another option for anyone uncomfortable sharing the common space. ""If someone wants to walk all the way over to the bar, there's a single stall there."" That restroom is labeled simply ""WC.""
For some transgender people, finding a single-toilet restroom is like finding an oasis in the desert.
""I plan my outings around bathrooms,"" said Kaylee Grundy, a transgender woman who lives on the west side of Houston and works downtown with Houston Unite, the pro-HERO group. As part of the HERO campaign, Grundy, 32, spent time at Alief High School training students in the gay-straight alliance to run a phone bank. Because she wasn't sure what the school's restroom situation would be, she planned ahead, acutely aware that she looks like a man in women's clothing.
""I stopped drinking water about six hours beforehand to make sure I absolutely didn't have to pee,"" Grundy said.
The Restroom Refuge app is a big help. It shows many more restrooms in places like New York and San Francisco, but Grundy tries to add as many as she can for Houston.
""I love Cinemark,"" she said. The theaters have ""family"" restrooms, and most H-E-Bs are accommodating.
Grundy has never had a problem at a restroom. ""I've spent my life being cautious,"" she said. Still, she fears someone will yell at her for being a man in a woman's restroom - or worse.
UHD opened a single-user restroom on its third floor last year, after reaching out to transgender students to ask about their experiences on campus. John Hudson, director for the school's Center for Student Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, heard that students traveled to other floors where a professor would guard the door while they used the restroom. One student refused to use any of the campus restroom facilities.
Work in progress
The single-user restroom also provided a place for student parents to go with their children, as well as privacy for students and staff with medical issues.
""And, of course, transgender students and staff can go there and be free of harassment,"" Hudson said.
Language and signs are still a work in progress, both in Houston and around the nation. UHD specifically avoided use of the phrase ""family restroom,"" Hudson said.
""We felt if we were trying to meet the needs of transgender students then we shouldn't hide behind that phrase, which some might find heterosexist,"" he said.
The UHD stick figure sign is ""imperfect,"" Hudson said, ""but we thought it was still a bold statement that let transgender students know, 'We're aware of you, and we want you to feel safe.'

11/6/15,19,Editorial / Columnists,Rangel: Which is the real anti-HERO - lies or apathy? ,"AUSTIN ‚Äî Once again, Texas Democrats and progressives are letting off steam and licking their wounds.
On election night, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa lashed out at Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and other leading opponents of a soundly defeated Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
""Tonight, a Republican message of misinformation and fear hurt the movement of equality for all in our great state,"" Hinojosa said in a statement.
This was in reference to TV ads claiming that under the ordinance ‚Äî which would have prohibited discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and 10 other categories ‚Äî men could go into women's bathrooms and other public facilities for ladies.
""It is grotesque and highly disturbing that the two highest statewide elected officials in Texas, Republican Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, went out of their way to play on people's fear,"" Hinojosa said.
The next day, a news watchdog even blamed the local media for the defeat of the ordinance, better known for its acronym HERO, and also dubbed as the ""bathroom ordinance.""
""HERO's opponents won a stunning victory, turning public opinion dramatically against a relatively popular ordinance,"" Media Matters for America said in reference to the 62 percent to 38 percent vote against it.
""That victory is thanks in part to local media's abysmal coverage of the fight over HERO, which was plagued by the widely-debunked myth that the ordinance would allow sexual predators to sneak into women's restrooms by pretending to be transgender ‚Äî a bogus talking point championed by HERO's opponents,"" the organization said in a statement.
Yet another major reason for the ordinance's defeat was hardly blamed ‚Äî voter apathy.
Although the controversial measure, and to a lesser degree a crowded mayoral race, received state and national attention, only 27 percent of Houston's registered voters went to the polls.
Actually, that was high by Texas standards because the state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nation. For instance, the statewide turnout for the seven state propositions was 11 percent.
Moreover, though a detailed analysis of Tuesday's vote hasn't been done, it appears Republican voters everywhere were more motivated than Democrats.
In San Antonio, a light turnout in a crowded special election for Texas House District 118, a safe Democratic district for generations, allowed a Republican hopeful to finish first and he will face a Democrat in a runoff election.
In all, what happened in Houston and San Antonio on Tuesday is not unusual.
In a runoff mayoral election in San Antonio in June, former state Sen. Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, who was also last year's Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, lost to Ivy Taylor, a city council-appointed mayor who was seeking a full two-year term of her own ‚Äî due to a high turnout in two heavily Republican city council districts.
And two months earlier, then-state Rep. Jose Menendez pulled a major upset ‚Äî because of a high Republican turnout, too ‚Äî when he defeated fellow House Democrat Trey Martinez Fischer in a nasty runoff for Van de Putte's Senate seat.
In those elections the overall vote was also anemic even though the mayoral race received lots of attention because it was the office vacated by now-U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, a rising star in the Democratic Party.
And then there is the so-called ""sleeping giant,"" also known as the Hispanic vote.

11/6/15,19,Editorial / Columnists,Rangel: Which is the real anti-HERO - lies or apathy? ,"AUSTIN ‚Äî Once again, Texas Democrats and progressives are letting off steam and licking their wounds.
On election night, Texas Democratic Party Chairman Gilberto Hinojosa lashed out at Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and other leading opponents of a soundly defeated Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
""Tonight, a Republican message of misinformation and fear hurt the movement of equality for all in our great state,"" Hinojosa said in a statement.
This was in reference to TV ads claiming that under the ordinance ‚Äî which would have prohibited discrimination based on race, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity and 10 other categories ‚Äî men could go into women's bathrooms and other public facilities for ladies.
""It is grotesque and highly disturbing that the two highest statewide elected officials in Texas, Republican Gov. Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, went out of their way to play on people's fear,"" Hinojosa said.
The next day, a news watchdog even blamed the local media for the defeat of the ordinance, better known for its acronym HERO, and also dubbed as the ""bathroom ordinance.""
""HERO's opponents won a stunning victory, turning public opinion dramatically against a relatively popular ordinance,"" Media Matters for America said in reference to the 62 percent to 38 percent vote against it.
""That victory is thanks in part to local media's abysmal coverage of the fight over HERO, which was plagued by the widely-debunked myth that the ordinance would allow sexual predators to sneak into women's restrooms by pretending to be transgender ‚Äî a bogus talking point championed by HERO's opponents,"" the organization said in a statement.
Yet another major reason for the ordinance's defeat was hardly blamed ‚Äî voter apathy.
Although the controversial measure, and to a lesser degree a crowded mayoral race, received state and national attention, only 27 percent of Houston's registered voters went to the polls.
Actually, that was high by Texas standards because the state has one of the lowest voter turnouts in the nation. For instance, the statewide turnout for the seven state propositions was 11 percent.
Moreover, though a detailed analysis of Tuesday's vote hasn't been done, it appears Republican voters everywhere were more motivated than Democrats.
In San Antonio, a light turnout in a crowded special election for Texas House District 118, a safe Democratic district for generations, allowed a Republican hopeful to finish first and he will face a Democrat in a runoff election.
In all, what happened in Houston and San Antonio on Tuesday is not unusual.
In a runoff mayoral election in San Antonio in June, former state Sen. Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, who was also last year's Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, lost to Ivy Taylor, a city council-appointed mayor who was seeking a full two-year term of her own ‚Äî due to a high turnout in two heavily Republican city council districts.
And two months earlier, then-state Rep. Jose Menendez pulled a major upset ‚Äî because of a high Republican turnout, too ‚Äî when he defeated fellow House Democrat Trey Martinez Fischer in a nasty runoff for Van de Putte's Senate seat.
In those elections the overall vote was also anemic even though the mayoral race received lots of attention because it was the office vacated by now-U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, a rising star in the Democratic Party.
And then there is the so-called ""sleeping giant,"" also known as the Hispanic vote.
Although San Antonio's population is more than 60 percent Hispanic and in Houston it is nearly 45 percent, one of the biggest constituencies for Democrats, the HERO and Van De Putte defeats reaffirmed Democrats don't motivate their political base as much as Republicans motivate theirs.
As some commentators have noted, if Democrats everywhere motivated their base a little more, Republicans might not control Congress and both legislative chambers in 29 statehouses.
In short, voter apathy is something Democratic leaders in Texas and throughout the nation will have to address between now and Nov. 8, 2016, otherwise their party could suffer a more devastating blow ‚Äî especially if it loses the presidency.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,675,91.59,42.67,29.24,16.83,20.45,31.11,77.78,54.96,43.11,4.59,1.78,0,0.15,0,0.44,0.89,2.81,14.07,8.59,2.81,13.48,5.04,3.7,6.52,0.59,8.74,7.85,5.48,6.52,0.74,1.78,4.59,9.78,0.59,9.04,0.89,1.93,0.89,1.33,0.15,3.7,0,5.78,2.67,2.96,1.78,0.15,1.48,0.3,0.3,0.15,0,8.44,4.59,0.15,0.3,0.74,1.19,1.19,4.59,0,0,0.59,0.44,8,7.56,0.3,0.15,2.67,0.74,0.44,1.33,0,0.15,1.04,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.3,0.15,0.3,0,0.15,0,0.15,0.3,0.15,2.22,9.63,0.74,1.04,7.26,0.3,0.15,0.3,3.56,4.3,2.22,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,16.44,5.04,6.67,0,0,2.07,2.67,0,0.15,0,0.15,0.3,0,2.75,3.03,2.56,2.74,2.3,-2.72,-1.96,-1.04,-1.79,-1.8,0.59,0,0.15,0.59,0.45,0.15,0.59,0,0.45,0,0.15,0.45,0.59,0.15,0.89,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.3,0,0,0.15,1.82,2.48,17.81,103.86,0.59,252.23,-0.74,59.35,0.59,163.2,0.15,103.86,-0.74,400.59,0,207.72,0,430.27,0.89,29.67,0.3,0,0,59.35,192.88,252.23,0,89.02,133.53,-0.15,44.51,178.04,59.35,29.67,14.84,-0.15,14.84,103.86,0,118.69,14.84,0,0,1.34,1,0.44,0.44,0.15,0,0,0,0.29,0,0.15,0,0.15,0.15,1

""We felt if we were trying to meet the needs of transgender students then we shouldn't hide behind that phrase, which some might find heterosexist,"" he said.
The UHD stick figure sign is ""imperfect,"" Hudson said, ""but we thought it was still a bold statement that let transgender students know, 'We're aware of you, and we want you to feel safe.'

Not shamed
Regarding ""HERO dealt crushing defeat; Turner, King set for runoff"" (Page A1, Wednesday), it was pathetic to hear Mayor Annise Parker blame the bigots and the right-wing cabal for the defeat of HERO. This, in light of the almost two-thirds vote of the people of Houston who rejected it.
All the elites tried to shame us that we would be bigots if we rejected this ordinance: the movie stars, the media, the political heavyweights (e.g. Hillary Clinton), the clergy who were rebuffed by their congregations, the business money grabbers. In short, the elites who know more than all those common folks who simply did not want their women embarrassed and their young daughters traumatized by seeing grown men dressed as women invade the privacy of their lives.
Peter Riga, Houston Democracy
The overwhelming defeat of the HERO initiative is the manifestation of democracy at work. No amount of mayoral arrogance, City Council votes or sermon subpoenas can overrule the will of decent, reasonable people.
State and local election results around the country seem to be saying the people are tired of the arrogance of leaders and tyranny of some of the public.
I am anxious to see the same result play out in our national elections next November.
Jim Maury, Burnet
Fight continues
Proposition 1 was lost. But we may rest assured that the campaign for equal rights for all is by no means over. It is such a shame that in this day and age, fear-mongering and misguided rhetoric can deter a much-needed civil rights measure.
Prop 1 was not simply about letting transgender men enter women's bathrooms. That was a misguided notion greatly distorted by the proposition's opponents. It protected the rights of everyone against undue discrimination.
Veterans, as an example, should not be discriminated against in employment. Since my son is serving in the Air Force, this struck a sympathetic note with me.
John L. Indo, Houston WWJD?
It is good that so many local preachers expressed themselves about HERO. Now we can tell which of them believe what Jesus said about love and acceptance and which ones were just jumping on the bandwagon of fear and hatred.
Stella Fitzgibbons, The Woodlands Business matters
As I travel the state talking to leaders in the business community, I hear constantly that Republican policies in Texas, such as our massive debt, declining roads, inadequate public education, irrational immigration laws and dysfunctional water systems are bad for business.
Now we see top Republican leaders Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott shooting down HERO on false claims that it will make bathrooms dangerous.
Business leaders in Houston have been saying for weeks this will be bad for business. So much for trusting Republican politicians to be pro-business.
Mike Collier, Kingwood Flawed process
Mayor Annise Parker - for whom I voted three times and whose rain tax I support - famously said: ""I will be mayor for all Houstonians"" - that is, until we attempt to submit her proposals to a referendum or vote them down.
I'm glad Texans still don't take kindly to having things shoved down their throats.
Kathleen Weber, Houston
Houston's heart
With the rejection of the HERO equal rights ordinance, Houston is sending a message to the world, especially to anyone who might consider coming here with a new high-tech business, a big convention, or a major entertainment or sports event.
Here is the message: We are a bustling city with gleaming skyscrapers, a booming economy, world-class music, arts and museums, and two Tier One research universities.
But at heart we are still a backward little cow town, ignorant and gullible. Take your business elsewhere. Keith M. Parsons, Friendswood

Lawsuit abuse
Regarding ""Texas lawyer indicted over BP spill claims"" (Page B2, Oct. 22), recent news of the indictment of a politically active personal injury lawyer in San Antonio is concerning. The lawyer is accused of being involved in fraudulent buying and selling of civil lawsuits.
For years, some personal injury lawyers have claimed they care about their clients and instead treat them like a commodity, which undermines our justice system and undercuts the major reforms our state has made over the past 20 years.
Texas has become a national model for meaningful legal reform. Once known as a ""judicial hellhole,"" our state has become an economic powerhouse, due in part to people being watchdogs in their communities and calling out lawsuit abuse when they see it.
By preserving and advancing meaningful legal reforms, we can help drive job creation and greater economic prosperity for our state. But it's on us to do our part in protecting our courts and the rights of consumers.
We must continue to be on the lookout for those personal injury lawyers trying to take advantage of the system. Together we can stop our courts from being used for greed, not justice.Hazel Meaux, board of directors, Texans Against Lawsuit Abuse, Austin",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,819,79.91,81.78,14.17,10.53,18.2,25.52,82.66,58.12,46.15,10.13,6.47,1.1,2.69,0.12,0.12,1.59,3.66,13.43,7.2,1.22,13.43,6.96,3.05,5.01,0.98,12.45,5.74,3.3,10.99,3.79,0.98,6.59,9.65,0.73,8.79,1.1,0.98,1.34,1.22,0.73,3.17,0,7.08,3.05,4.03,2.08,0.49,1.47,0.37,0.12,0,0,16,6.59,0.61,0.24,1.34,2.2,1.22,10.13,0.37,0.12,0.61,0.61,4.03,4.03,0,0,6.35,0.85,0,3.91,2.08,0.61,1.22,0.61,0,0,0.12,0,0,0,0,0.12,0.12,0.61,0.12,0,0.12,0.12,0.37,0.49,4.27,6.59,0.24,0.73,4.64,0.98,0.37,0,2.93,2.56,3.66,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,16,5.86,5.86,0.12,0,0.73,3.42,0,0.85,0,0.49,0.12,0.61,3.32,3.73,3.29,3.21,2.85,-3.39,-2.23,-1.19,-1.53,-2.14,0.73,0.49,0.37,0.49,2.08,0.61,0.61,0,0.85,0,0.12,0,0.85,0.49,0.98,0,0,0,0.49,0.12,0.12,0.12,0,0,2.71,2.76,20.66,207.57,0.98,561.66,-0.49,244.2,0.61,293.04,2.08,97.68,-0.98,354.09,-0.61,549.45,0,207.57,0.61,24.42,0.24,12.21,0,61.05,170.94,293.04,12.21,24.42,61.05,0.24,170.94,48.84,12.21,85.47,24.42,0.24,0,85.47,36.63,354.09,24.42,24.42,0,0.61,1,0.12,0.73,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.12,0,0.12,0,1
11/5/15,19,Business,"Tourism, recruiting are worries after HERO defeat - Backers say corporate relocations and sporting events are at risk, but opponents argue city will be fine ","Business and tourism leaders worried Wednesday that voters' rejection of a citywide anti-discrimination ordinance has hurt what had been one of their best recruiting tools: Houston's emerging reputation as a diverse metropolis that supported an openly gay mayor and welcomes young talent looking to launch careers in a progressive environment.
Suddenly at risk, they say, are corporate relocations, nationally prominent sporting events and the lucrative convention business that generate millions of dollars and help the region thrive.
""In recent years, we have done a remarkable job of changing the perception and attracting people to Houston,"" said Bob Harvey, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. "" ... We have to quickly re-establish that this is a modern, open city.""
Voters on Tuesday rejected the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, by a 2-to-1 margin, setting up what supporters of the law warn could be repercussions, from business boycotts to the loss of high-profile sporting events.
""I absolutely fear there will be a direct economic backlash,"" Mayor Annise Parker said.
Such arguments were quickly dismissed by HERO's foes in the aftermath of the ordinance's defeat. And sponsors of the Super Bowl, which is coming to Houston in 2017, and the Final Four scheduled here next year, announced they have no plans to take away Houston's awards.
Steve Hotze, a vocal opponent of HERO who also led a 1985 effort to kill an ordinance to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation, said people were coming to Houston for decades before either item was considered.
""I beat this in 1985, and Houston was fine,"" Hotze said. ""Houston will be fine.""
Hotze said HERO was being pushed by ""fringe radical groups."" But an analysis by the Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign found that 89 percent of Fortune magazine's 500 largest publicly traded companies have policies prohibiting discrimination.
Mike Waterman, president of the Greater Houston Convention and Visitors Bureau, the group that recruits conventions that draw tens of thousands of people here annually, said many of those top organizers hope the new mayoral administration will pass an alternative measure quickly.
""We can't go on as a city without a non-discrimination ordinance forever,"" Waterman said. ""It's a differentiator, and one we do not have today.""
'The true Houston'
The Greater Houston Hotel & Lodging Association, which like the other booster group was vocal in its support of HERO, echoed that concern.
""I think the issue we face is we want people outside our city to know the true Houston, that we are very open and welcoming to all visitors,"" association president Stephanie Haynes said.
Some of the biggest draws in recent years have been sporting events. Houston is gearing up now for its third turn hosting the Super Bowl, in 2017. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, immediately asked NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for an emergency meeting ""to discuss the future of nondiscrimination protections"" in Houston.
The NFL, which moved the location of the 1993 Super Bowl from Arizona because the state had rejected making Martin Luther King Jr. Day an official state holiday, issued a statement on Wednesday assuring that the 2017 game will not be moved from Houston, although it said it would work closely with the local host committee ""to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events.""
Likewise, the NCAA said it does not intend to move next year's Final Four from Houston, although it would consider Tuesday's vote when looking at future bids.
And although organizers of the College Football Playoff did not award Houston any of the three games it was seeking in 2018-2020, executive director Bill Hancock said Tuesday's vote had nothing to do with it.
""Political considerations did not enter into this discussion in any way,"" he said. Predicts it won't be an issue
Houston Texans owner Bob McNair, who gave $10,000 to the anti-HERO campaign but later withdrew his donation after it became public, predicted the ordinance's failure to pass ""won't be an issue"" when the city bids for future Super Bowls.
He also addressed HERO itself.
""I was opposed to it because I thought it was unreasonable, and apparently, a large majority of the voters felt the same way,"" McNair said. ""If we can come up with something reasonable, I'd be supportive of it.""
There also was concern Wednesday that the defeat of HERO could make the city unattractive to diverse job candidates, including the increasingly sought-after millennial workers, said Keith Wolf, managing director of Murray Resources, a recruiting and staffing firm in Houston.
""I think the larger concern is that it feeds into the misperception by some that Houston and Texas, in general, is an intolerant, unwelcoming place,"" Wolf said.
""If you've been on Facebook and Twitter in the last 24 hours, you've probably seen millennials expressing their embarrassment that the ordinance did not pass,"" he added.
Millennials and social issues
Harvey, of the Greater Houston Partnership, said it will be hard to know how many companies might avoid Houston because of the vote, but he said he agreed that major companies are eager for young professional workers. Those recruits, he said, care about social issues.
States and cities that have passed measures seen as discriminatory have experienced economic backlash, said Stacey Long Simmons, director of public policy and government at the National LGBTQ Task Force.
""Companies recognize that discrimination will affect their bottom line,"" she said. Long Simmons called the vote a black mark on Houston's reputation.
""Houston was known as a place intolerant of discrimination, truly embracing diversity and inclusion,"" she said. ""Now it will have to fight hard to convince people otherwise.""
After the polls closed Tuesday, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick repeated the assertion that the ordinance would permit men to enter women's restrooms, and said any businesses that wanted to boycott Houston ""were on the wrong side of the issue."" ""We have 600 to 700 people a day moving to Texas,"" Patrick said. ""You know why? Because they see Texas as the America that all America used to be. We stand for God. We stand for guns. Guess what, we also stand up for the privacy of women in the bathroom. If I'm a business guy somewhere else, that's the kind of place I want to be.""
Outsiders' views of Texas
Phillip Jones, president and CEO of the Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau, sees things differently. He said he already faces an uphill battle explaining Texas to outsiders and called Tuesday's rejection of HERO a ""black eye"" for the whole state.
""From an image perspective, it hurts the Texas image of being a tolerant, inclusive state,"" Jones said. ""From a selfish meeting- planner perspective, it could hurt Houston and Dallas for recruiting for those who want to bring business to an inclusive place.""
But he also sees opportunity, pointing out that Dallas County and the city of Dallas have anti-discrimination ordinances and require domestic partner benefits.
""I feel bad for Houston from an economic perspective and a message perspective,"" Jones said. ""If you hear about anyone wanting to leave Houston, send them my way.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1176,81.97,58.78,31.03,25.74,20.63,26.87,82.31,60.29,45.32,9.18,4.34,0.94,1.19,0.34,1.02,0.6,4.85,13.35,8.33,1.87,12.41,6.97,2.98,5.19,0.94,15.39,5.78,3.06,7.06,2.3,0.77,3.91,10.46,0.51,9.78,2.21,1.62,1.28,1.36,0.26,3.23,0,4.51,2.47,2.04,0.77,0.09,0.68,0.17,0.09,0,0,15.31,8.59,1.02,0.26,1.45,1.28,3.32,6.72,0,0,0.34,1.19,2.04,2.04,0,0,6.29,1.62,0,4,1.19,0.09,1.19,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,0.26,0.26,0.09,0.51,0.51,0.17,0.26,0,0,0.6,0.43,0.09,4.17,9.35,0.51,1.7,5.36,1.19,0.17,0.68,4.25,6.12,1.96,2.04,0.09,0,0.09,0,0,20.32,5.19,6.8,0.09,0,2.13,6.12,0,0.43,0,0.09,0.09,0.26,3.23,3.45,3.38,3.37,2.63,-2.6,-1.1,0.01,-0.9,-1.68,0.34,0.51,0.34,0.43,0.43,0.34,0.6,0.17,0.77,0,0.09,0.09,0.77,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,0.17,0,0,1.86,1.67,18.07,161.56,1.45,331.63,-0.34,187.07,1.53,153.06,1.19,153.06,-1.53,229.59,0.68,459.18,0,144.56,-0.17,17.01,0.17,17.01,0,17.01,136.05,178.57,42.52,8.5,76.53,0.17,195.58,85.03,8.5,59.52,8.5,-0.09,0,153.06,8.5,229.59,34.01,25.51,17.01,1.36,1,0.34,2.21,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,0.34,0.09,0,0,1
11/5/15,19,B,"Election reflection - After the heat of democracy in action, Houstonians await runoffs and new policies. ","Election night and runoffs
If you were waiting for the final votes to be tallied Tuesday night, we hope you didn't plan on waking up early Wednesday. County Clerk Stan Stanart still hadn't documented every precinct as the clock approached 1 a.m. Nevertheless, voter turnout was higher than average for Houston. More than 263,000 votes were counted, or about 27 percent of registered voters. Turnout for a municipal election hasn't topped 20 percent since 2003, when former Mayor Bill White first ran for office.
Plenty of the Chronicle's endorsed candidates emerged victorious - Councilman Michael Kubosh received more votes than any other person on the ballot. Others will face a runoff in December. However, we were particularly disappointed to see a candidate like Tom McCasland fail to make it to the next round. As Jay Kumar Aiyer, an assistant professor of public policy at Texas Southern University, said on the ""Houston Matters"" radio program: The former CEO of the Harris County Housing Authority was probably the most qualified candidate anywhere on the ballot.
Policy wonk Ann McCoy also looked like a perfect fit for public service, but she lost her race for Houston Independent School District trustee. We hope to see both run again.
Until then, we're looking forward to a heated mayoral runoff between Sylvester Turner and Bill King. Turner earned our endorsement in the first round, but we were left wanting by his election-night speech. The next few weeks will be the perfect opportunity for the state representative to articulate how he'll address the litany of problems facing City Hall. There's little doubt Turner has an impressive command of rhetoric, but voters deserve policy over platitudes.
State propositions
Minor tax cuts, major budget diversions and the right of politicians to work from home were among the many changes approved by Texans in statewide constitutional amendments. The seven propositions all passed easily, but judging the long-term effects of these new policies will be harder.
During the next legislative session, keep an eye out for how Prop 7's dedicated road funding affects the rest of the budget. Removing the requirement that statewide elected officers reside in Austin will also make it easier for those politicians to avoid the scrutiny of the Capitol press corps and the Travis County DA. And the newly created constitutional right to hunt and fish sets the stage for conflicts with necessary environmental regulations and local control.
Houston Independent School District shakeup
HISD is currently searching for a new superintendent, but the results from Tuesday's election will likely throw a wrench into any plans for a seamless process.
Trustees Rhonda Skillern-Jones, the board president, and Manuel Rodriguez Jr., the vice president, are both headed for December runoff elections.
Meanwhile, former Houston councilwoman Jolanda Jones was swept into the open seat for District IV without the need for a runoff. In District VII, incumbent Trustee Juliet K. Stipeche lost to former Trustee Diana Davila, who unexpectedly resigned her position in 2010 after she tried to appoint her husband to an HISD committee that oversaw a nearly $1 billion construction program. At the time, the district's inspector general said the appointment would be a conflict of interest. Neither a self-proclaimed fighter like Jones nor a scandal-tainted ex-trustee like Davila give us a sense of confidence that they'll provide a steady hand during this moment of change at HISD.
New term limits approved
While all the attention was on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, the approval of Houston's Proposition 2 will likely have a more substantial effect on city governance. Instead of serving three, two-year terms, now elected officials at City Hall will serve two, four- year terms. Council members re-elected for their second term this year will be allowed to stack those eight years on top of their first two-year term, for a maximum of 10 years.
This change will give elected officials the opportunity to focus on the persisting, long-term challenges at City Hall, such as pension obligations, infrastructure and sustainable growth. However, four-year terms also grant an already-powerful mayor even more time to raise money and implement policy before having to face an election.

11/5/15,19,Local News,Patrick says state voters' approval of Proposition 1 a first step in tax relief - Patrick talks taxes and HERO ,"In a news conference Thursday at the Texas Federation of Republican Women convention in Lubbock, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said state voters' recent passage of Proposition 1 was just the first step in property tax relief.
Patrick was just one of many politicians in town for the biennial convention, as attendees also heard from state House Speaker Joe Straus and former Gov. Rick Perry.
The convention continues Friday and Saturday at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center, with upcoming guests including Gov. Greg Abbott and Presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.
Patrick talks taxes and HERO
Given the newly approved increase in homestead exceptions, Patrick said the next step should either be to reduce the maximum amount appraisal districts can increase property values or to lower the rollback rate on property taxes that requires cities and counties to hold elections if they exceed it.
""As appraisals go up, dollar per dollar, the taxes go up. We want our homes to increase in value, but we can't be taxed dollar per dollar on that,"" Patrick said.
Bills intending to do both of these were introduced this past legislative session but did not make it out of committee. At the time they were brought up, several members of the Lubbock City Council and the Lubbock County Commissioners Court spoke out in opposition to the legislation, saying it jeopardizes the ability to fund services and takes away local control.
Patrick said the measures would prevent taxes from going up to unaffordable levels.
""Now that the voters have spoken so clearly they want property tax relief, we should get some extra clout to get that done. I've been fighting for this for a long time,"" he said.
Some of the concerns over Proposition 1 are coming from the school districts that worry how this will impact funding long term. Reports from the Lubbock Independent School District say it expected a $3.3 million-a-year decrease in funding, which the Legislature has promised to make up this biennium, but there are no provisions of making up that difference moving forward, according to LISD spokeswoman Nancy Sharp.
To this, Patrick said, ""They don't know what they're talking about.""
Patrick said the state is reimbursing the school districts for the amount of money they'll lose. The state can only fund school districts two years at a time, which is the worrisome part for the districts.
Patrick also had kind words to say to the voters in Houston who resoundingly repealed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, aimed at preventing discrimination based on things like sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents of the bill fought against the part about protection to use preferred public bathrooms, thus dubbing it the Houston Bathroom Act.
Thursday morning
It was a political frenzy at the Lubbock Memorial Civic Center as convention attendees were registering, stopping by booths and talking with candidates at a meet and greet. There are some merchandise vendors, but most of the booths set up are for elected officials and candidates. The two presidential candidate booths are for Cruz and surgeon Ben Carson.
Lily Schoop is the West Texas regional chairwoman for Carson's campaign and said her booth had been a popular destination all morning, especially among people wanting to take pictures with the cardboard cutout of Carson.
She said she's at the convention to show people why Carson is the best candidate.
Deborah Wall is a volunteer for Cruz's presidential campaign and a member of the San Antonio Republican Women. She said she was in attendance to answer any questions people have about the candidate.
Convention Coordinator Nitra Barnes said the event aims to educate and encourage constituents to participate in government. Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush, Abbott, Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton also have booths.
U.S. House District 19 candidates Glen Robertson, Jodey Arrington, Donald May and DeRenda Warren were among those present, fielding questions, taking donations and seeking volunteers.
Other guests
Most of the day was spent in the Civic Center's auditorium, where members of the TFRW were welcomed by Lubbock-area state Reps. Dustin Burrows and John Frullo, heard from Straus and were presented the story of and by two men who survived the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012.
""I can assure you that on behalf of the Republican members of the Texas House, we will be ready to rally behind our nominee and run on the positive results that we have delivered,"" Straus said. ""But we can't do it without you; we're once again counting on you to lift Republican legislators to victory.""
The two Benghazi survivors, Mark Geist and John Tiegen, were working as private security contractors when the U.S. diplomatic mission was attacked by Islamist militants. Providing photos and aerial footage, Geist and Tiegen discussed the lack of security that was at the consulate and the hours they'd spent fighting.

11/5/15,19,National,"Annise Parker, Houston mayor, rips defeat of transgender 'bathroom bill,' predicts economic backlash ","Houston Mayor Annise Parker wasn't exactly gracious in defeat, accusing those who opposed the city's transgender-rights ordinance of ""deliberate lies"" and predicting the city's economy would suffer as a result of the measure's repeal.
In remarks shortly after Tuesday's balloting, Ms. Parker blamed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance's lopsided loss on ""a very small but determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religionist right"" for waging ""a campaign of fear-mongering and deliberate lies.""
The ordinance, named Proposition 1 on the city ballot, lost by 62 to 38 percent despite the strong support of national gay-rights organizations, who poured millions into the local campaign, as well as pro-business groups.
""And truly, unfortunately, I fear that this will have stained Houston's reputation as a tolerant, welcoming global city, and I absolutely fear that there will be a direct economic backlash as a result of this ordinance going into defeat,"" Ms. Parker said in a video posted on KHOU-TV. ""And that's sad for Houston and sad for all of us.""
The ordinance, passed by city council in 2014, gave protected class status based on 15 characteristics, including race, ethnicity, gender, age and religion, as well as sexual orientation and gender identity. Most of those are already listed under federal and state law.
Ms. Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major U.S. city, said the voters' rejection of Proposition 1 puts Houston out of step with other jurisdictions, arguing that 17 states and 200 cities have passed similar measures.
But Houston's ordinance went beyond other anti-discrimination codes by adding penalties and fines of up to $5,000 for anyone who tries to stop someone from using a public restroom that corresponds with their gender identity.
The opposition drove home that point with the slogan, ""No Men in Women's Bathrooms,"" and an explosive television ad showing a man cornering a little girl in a bathroom stall.
The fight over the ordinance comes with Ms. Parker, who is term-limited, poised to leave office after voters select a replacement in December from the top two finishers in Tuesday's balloting, state Rep. Sylvester Turner and former Kemah mayor Bill King.
Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican who filmed an ad opposing Proposition 1, told supporters after the vote that he was ""disappointed that the mayor could not be gracious tonight.""
""I'm disappointed that in her waning hours of being in office, she's still divisive,"" Mr. Patrick said. ""But mayor, you're wrong. And the people of Texas ... and Houston have made it very clear this is not the kind of city that they want to live in.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,430,92.13,62.14,30.75,1.72,22.63,23.26,80.47,56.28,44.88,7.67,3.49,0.7,0.23,0.23,0.7,0.47,4.19,14.42,8.6,3.02,15.81,4.19,2.79,6.74,0.93,10.23,5.58,2.79,3.72,0.7,0.47,2.56,8.37,0.47,7.44,0.47,1.16,0.7,0.93,0.47,3.02,0,6.28,1.63,4.65,1.86,0,1.86,0.47,0.23,0.93,0,14.88,6.98,0.7,1.86,1.86,0.7,1.4,7.91,0,0,2.09,1.16,4.42,3.95,0.23,0.23,2.79,0.47,0.23,0.93,0.7,0.47,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,2.56,9.77,0,2.09,7.21,0.47,0.23,0,3.26,4.19,2.33,0.93,0.23,0,0.23,0,0,23.72,6.51,7.44,0,0,3.49,6.28,0,0.93,0,0,0.93,0,3.65,3.59,3.35,3.5,2.99,-5.5,-3.76,-2.01,-2.74,-3.61,0.23,0.7,0,0.47,0.7,0,0.7,0,0.23,0,0.23,0.47,0.7,0.93,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,1.9,2.93,16.57,116.28,1.16,255.81,0.23,23.26,0,186.05,0.7,139.53,-0.47,395.35,-0.47,348.84,0,232.56,0.47,46.51,0.47,0,0,69.77,232.56,302.33,23.26,23.26,46.51,0,116.28,186.05,23.26,0,0,0,0,23.26,23.26,69.77,46.51,23.26,0,0.93,1,0,1.16,0,0,0,0,0.23,1.16,0,0,0,0,1
11/5/15,19,USA,Houston's rejection of LGBT protections could ripple far beyond Texas ,"
Dubbed ""the bathroom ordinance,"" a broad equal-rights measure that would extend protection in public spaces regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity in Houston, failed miserably Tuesday after a 61-to-39 vote.
The ordinance included protections for a wide range of minority groups, including the elderly and military veterans. However, the sticking point for many Houston voters was a clause that would permit transgender individuals to use public restrooms designated for the gender with which they identify, an issue that has become increasingly prominent as the concerns of transgender people have become increasingly public.
The fact that the ordinance failed in liberal Houston, one of the first cities in the United States to elect an openly gay mayor, has served as a wakeup call for advocates.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost unbelievable that this could happen in a city like Houston,‚Äù Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, told The Associated Press. ‚ÄúBut make no mistake: if we don‚Äôt double down today, we‚Äôll face the same thing again and again in cities across the nation.‚Äù
And nondiscrimination advocates may face similar opposition sooner than they think.
The outcome in Houston has already strengthened a movement in California, where the 2013 legislature permitted transgender students use facilities based on their gender identity. Opponents, including Karen England and her organization Privacy for All, are promoting a 2016 ballot measure that would overturn the 2013 legislature and require people to use facilities based on their ‚Äúbiological sex.‚Äù
Opponents of the Houston measure highlighted concerns that eliminating biological designations for bathroom use could open the door for sexual predators to victimize women in the vulnerable position of using the restroom.
‚ÄúThe voters clearly understand that this proposition was never about equality ‚Äì that is already the law,‚Äù Texas Lt. Gov. Dan
Patrick said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt was about allowing men to enter women‚Äôs restrooms and locker rooms ‚Äì defying common sense and common decency.‚Äù
Advocates who are dismayed by the fearful tone that crept into the debate leading up to the vote in Houston are rethinking how they can reframe the discussion to alleviate such concerns.
‚ÄúUltimately, for almost everyone, politics is driven by an emotional reaction to something,‚Äù Erik Fogg, founder of Something to Consider, told The Christian Science Monitor‚Äôs Jessica Mendoza. ‚ÄúProgressives have to make [the issue] emotionally positive and resonant rather than frightening.‚Äù
In retrospect, advocates of local nondiscrimination laws say they could have done more to support ""the bathroom ordinance.""
Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, told The Associated Press that nondiscrimination advocates should have stressed potential economic losses from the ordinance‚Äôs failure. Instead, supporters advertised the ideal of universal of discrimination protection; an argument that experts say other minorities simply didn‚Äôt buy.
‚ÄúThey had allies in the African-American community, who are traditionally Democratic and progressive voters but did not buy into the argument that gays and more specifically transgender (people) are a group that needs to be protected,‚Äù said Stein.
Some supporters question if they could have pushed a more successful campaign rooted in economic arguments, with more leadership by Houston‚Äôs lesbian Mayor Annise Parker.
‚ÄúI fear this will have stained Houston‚Äôs reputation as a tolerant, welcoming, global city,‚Äù said Mayor Parker. ‚ÄúAnd I absolutely fear that there will be a direct, economic backlash as a result of this ordinance going into defeat.‚Äù",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,553,88.76,57.32,15.28,4.6,23.04,32.19,81.74,58.23,46.11,7.41,2.71,0.36,0.36,0,0.18,1.45,4.7,16.09,9.95,1.08,13.2,7.23,3.8,4.34,0.9,13.2,6.87,2.35,7.05,1.27,1.45,4.88,12.84,0.72,12.12,1.45,2.89,2.17,1.81,0.54,3.25,0.18,3.8,0.72,2.71,2.17,0,1.81,0.9,0.54,0,0,13.38,5.79,0.36,0.36,1.27,0.72,2.71,7.05,0,0,0.72,0.18,4.52,4.16,0.36,0,2.35,0,0.18,1.45,0.54,0.18,2.35,0,0,0,0,0,1.08,0.18,0,0.72,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.72,0.36,3.07,7.96,0,0.9,6.69,0.18,0,0.18,2.17,3.8,2.53,1.63,0.18,0,0.18,0,0,17.72,4.34,5.61,0,0,1.63,6.15,0,0.54,0,0.18,0.54,0.18,4.08,4.06,3.7,3.75,3.31,-3.34,-2.55,-0.83,-1.48,-2.02,0.54,1.08,0.18,0.36,0.72,0.18,1.27,0,1.27,0,0.36,0.54,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.16,1.32,17.14,144.67,1.45,271.25,-0.9,126.58,1.27,235.08,0.72,126.58,-1.08,253.16,0.9,289.33,0,217,-0.72,36.17,0.36,18.08,0,54.25,108.5,180.83,36.17,0,108.5,0.18,108.5,126.58,0,54.25,0,0,0,90.42,18.08,54.25,126.58,36.17,18.08,1.81,1,0.87,1.57,0.17,0,0,0,0.35,0,0.17,0.17,0.7,0,1
11/5/15,19,ASECTION,Big Houston defeat stuns LGBT activists ,"The landslide defeat of a nondiscrimination ordinance in Houston has stunned LGBT-rights activists across the nation. They're now bracing for their opponents in other states to seize on the successful tactic of stoking fears over transgender people's access to public restrooms.
By a margin of 61 percent to 39 percent, voters in America's fourth-largest city on Tuesday rejected a broad equal-rights ordinance - - extending protections in employment, housing and public spaces on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender identity and other categories. Opponents prevailed with a campaign that dubbed the measure ""the bathroom ordinance"" and raised the specter of male sexual predators invading women's restrooms.
In other late election results Tuesday night:
* WIN FOR AIRBNB -- San Francisco voters have rejected a proposal to restrict Airbnb and a second ballot measure prompted by the city's housing crisis.
Tuesday's vote went against restrictions on Airbnb and a ballot measure to freeze construction of luxury housing in the Mission District.
Airbnb, by far the world's largest home-share platform, spent more than $8 million to defeat the measure.
Proposition F would have limited home-shares to 75 nights and required Airbnb and other hosting platforms to pull listings that exceed the limit.
With more than 90,000 votes counted, 58 percent of the voters rejected the measure.
A proposal to freeze development of luxury housing in the city's trendy Mission District also lost with 60 percent of the votes against it.
Mayor Ed Lee, who swept through election victory, had opposed both measures.
*OHIO POT BACKERS MULL NEXT STEP -- Marijuana in Ohio faced an uncertain future Wednesday after the resounding defeat of an effort to legalize cannabis for medical and recreational use in a single vote -- although few believe the fight is over.
The proposal rejected by voters Tuesday is expected to be followed in 2016 by a more conventional legalization initiative, one that doesn't give exclusive growing rights to private investors.
There's also early talk of legislative action to legalize pot for medical use only. State Attorney General Mike DeWine said in May he was studying the plausibility of a tightly crafted medical marijuana proposal.
""I think there is consensus that it's not over and done, that some type of legalization of marijuana in Ohio is still going to be a part of the public discussion,"" said Joe Cornely of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation.
* MISSISSIPPI REJECTS SCHOOL AMENDMENT -- Mississippi voters rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required ""an adequate and efficient"" public school system and granted the courts power to enforce it. The measure came as state funding for schools has fallen short of what is called for under state law. * ENDANGERED SPECIES LAW PASSED IN WASHINGTON -- Washington voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative backed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and various animal-rights groups that will make it a state crime to buy, sell or trade products coming from certain wild animals. The ban targets endangered species of elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, lions, leopards, cheetahs, pangolins, marine turtles, sharks and rays.
* DEMOCRATS FALL SHORT IN VIRGINIA -- Republicans held onto the Virginia Senate in fiercely contested elections Tuesday, leaving Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe without legislative leverage or political momentum as he works to deliver Virginia for his friend and ally Hillary Clinton in 2016.
The outcome was a blunt rebuke to McAuliffe, who had barnstormed the state with 24 events over the past four days and who portrayed the elections as a make-or-break moment for his progressive agenda.
All 140 seats in the General Assembly were on the ballot.

11/5/15,19,B,"HERO's demise - Houston will have an equal rights ordinance, probably in the not-so-distant future. ","Supporters of Houston's equal rights ordinance have to live with at least two depressing facts of political life in the wake of HERO's demise: One, the numbers don't lie, and, two, the architects of the campaign against the ordinance do. In fact, the campaign they mounted, successful to be sure, qualifies as the dictionary definition of ""bad faith,"" a concept having to do in law and ethics with ""intent to deceive.""
Houstonians who voted against the ordinance may not have known it, but Jared Woodfill, Dr. Steven Hotze, Pastor Ed Young and other leaders of the anti-HERO campaign know full well that the ordinance had nothing to do with criminals invading women's restrooms. They also know that fear works, and to act on their antipathy toward gays, lesbians, bisexuals and the transgendered - the real reason for their opposition - they were willing to use whatever tool available. Never mind that their successful effort besmirches a city known for its tolerance and inclusivity or that it could cost Houston economically as companies, conventions and potential residents reconsider whether this is a city they want to call home. Never mind also that it conveys a message of hate and intolerance toward the GLBT community. As far as the opponents are concerned, the ordinance had to go by any means necessary, including a bald intent to deceive.
Of course, there are legitimate reasons for opposing HERO. Mayoral runoff candidate Bill King contends, for example, that the city doesn't need an extra layer of equal-rights protection. It's a position we don't share, but it's certainly worthy of consideration. Promulgating fears about a so-called ""bathroom ordinance"" was not a legitimate argument. It was nothing more than politics at their most cynical.
HERO supporters have to shoulder a certain amount of blame for what happened, none more so than Mayor Annise Parker. The first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city allowed the campaign for the ordinance to get personal, thereby deflecting attention from the broader purpose of an equal rights measure. A ham-handed city attorney's office didn't help, either. And, as it became obvious that opponents were willing to wage a scorched-city campaign of lies and deceit, proponents, including the Houston business community, were slow to respond, slow to point out the economic implications. And, finally, residents of Montrose, Meyerland and other areas of the city where the ordinance enjoyed strong support voted in paltry numbers.
Houston, the largest city in America without an equal rights ordinance, will have one, probably in the not-too-distant future after a new mayor takes office and begins repairing the damage. Meanwhile, the current mayor still has an opportunity to begin laying the groundwork for a retooled successor to HERO. She missed an opportunity during her embittered remarks late Tuesday night. We understand she was profoundly disappointed, and has a right to be, but the message she needed to convey, and must continue to convey, is that Houston is bigger - and better - than the election results suggest. She aimed at that during a follow-up press conference Wednesday, but that wasn't in front of a national audience.
In this diverse city of more than 2 million people, fewer than 160,000 voters rejected an ordinance designed to protect the equal rights of all; slightly more than 100,000 voted in favor. The nays prevailed, but they hardly reflect the openness, tolerance and respect for difference that make us proud to be Houstonians. That's the Houston we predict will ultimately prevail.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,577,88.54,43.11,30.12,43.46,23.08,29.12,85.79,63.95,50.09,7.63,3.29,0,0.69,0,0.87,1.56,4.33,16.81,10.05,1.56,15.6,6.76,2.95,6.93,2.08,12.82,8.15,5.55,8.15,1.73,1.91,4.68,14.04,1.04,12.48,2.08,2.08,0.87,1.04,1.04,5.2,0,5.89,3.64,2.08,1.73,0.35,1.21,0.35,0.35,0.35,0,15.08,6.93,0.69,0,1.04,1.73,1.91,7.11,0.35,0,1.21,0.17,3.12,3.12,0,0,3.12,0,0.52,1.56,0.87,0.35,1.73,0,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,0.17,2.08,0.17,0.35,0,0.35,0,0.69,0.35,0,2.95,6.41,0.52,0.69,5.37,0.17,0,0,3.64,3.99,3.12,1.73,0,0,0,0,0,18.37,4.85,7.97,0,0,2.08,3.47,0,1.39,0,0,0.17,0.35,3.44,3.74,3.37,3.31,2.9,-2.66,-0.71,0.31,-0.29,-0.89,0.17,0.87,0.35,0.17,1.56,0.35,0.52,0,1.04,0,0.35,0,1.39,0.17,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,2.59,2.26,16.12,155.98,1.21,519.93,0.17,259.97,1.21,173.31,1.39,103.99,-0.35,225.3,0.87,242.63,0,207.97,-0.35,17.33,0.17,0,0,17.33,207.97,155.98,17.33,0,69.32,0,86.66,51.99,0,51.99,0,0,0,86.66,34.66,138.65,34.66,0,0,1.04,1,0.35,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0,1
11/5/15,19,A,"ELECTION 2015 - Missteps leave HERO supporters, Garcia facing uncertain future - ANALYSIS - Ordinance failed with black voters; outreach 'too little, too late' ","
As supporters of Houston's equal rights ordinance pieced together how the law came to suffer such an overwhelming defeat at the polls Tuesday, political scientists and even some campaign supporters pointed to what they said was a key misstep: poor outreach to black voters.
Majority black City Council districts were among those most decisively rejecting the law Tuesday, including District B and District D, where 72 percent and 65 percent of voters, respectively, opted to repeal the law. Overall, complete but unofficial results showed
61 percent of voters against the law and 39 percent for it.
Heading into the election, polling showed black voters, traditionally more socially conservative, were the most likely to be undecided on the issue, said Bob Stein, a Rice University political scientist.
In the same polling, supporters did best with black voters when they presented the argument that repealing the ordinance would jeopardize the city's economy and events such as the Super Bowl and NCAA.
And while they touched on that issue in their $3 million campaign that more than tripled opponents' fundraising, it was just one of a slew of messages the group deployed in recent weeks.
Opponents of the law, meanwhile, focused almost singularly on the fact that the law would allow men dressed as women to enter women's restrooms. In their advertising campaign, they suggested this could include sexual predators.
The approached worked, political scientists said. The group's most talked-about ad featured a man, dressed in men's clothing, following a young girl into a women's restroom.
A more forceful economic argument most likely would not have changed the outcome of the election, Stein said, but it could have narrowed the margin and softened the defeat.
""I don't know why they didn't do this; I really don't,"" Stein said. ""Maybe it was because the people running the operation were not familiar with local campaigns and local politics, but that was their best argument.""
The pro-HERO campaign relied in part on outsiders to shape their message. They brought in national and state American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Campaign staffers to help spearhead the effort along with campaign manager Richard Carlbom, a strategist from Minnesota who led the state's recent marriage equality campaign.
'Hard to fight a lie'
Their opponents, however, relied mostly on local activists, helped in part by the Houston Area Pastor Council, which urged local ministers to speak out against HERO from the pulpit. They also were the first to hit the airwaves in mid-August, and their ads aired on several historically black stations.
Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city and a supporter of the law, said she expects there will be economic repercussions from the repeal. But she said it would have been ""inappropriate and irresponsible"" for the campaign to make ""threats"" about those possibilities in order to court voters.
Parker said that, ultimately, it was most difficult for supporters to overcome the bathroom claims and address the law's many protected groups.
""It's hard to fight, again, if a lie begins to resonate and it taps into a deep-rooted fear,"" Parker said. ""It's hard to counter that with logic.""
A KHOU/KUHF poll earlier this year showed the economic argument was particularly persuasive among black female voters. But even more broadly, the poll showed that among opponents of the law, 24 percent said they would change their mind if told that the National Football League would not come to Houston for the 2017 Super Bowl and the National College Athletic Association would take the Final Four elsewhere if the law was repealed.
The equal rights ordinance, known by the acronym HERO, banned discrimination based not just on gender identity and sexual orientation but also 13 classes already protected under federal law: sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing and city contracting were all subject to the law and faced up to $5,000 in fines for violations. Religious institutions, however, were exempt.
Monica Roberts, a transgender black woman and GLBT activist, called the Houston Unites effort a ""whitewashed campaign"" that failed to adequately respond to the bathroom issue and reach out to the black community in a meaningful way.
On her popular blog, TransGriot, she wrote that the warning signs that the law could go down by a significant margin were present early on.""
""The Black LGBT community and our allies have been warning for months that action was needed in our community IMMEDIATELY or else HERO was going down to defeat,"" she wrote. ""We pleaded for canvassing in our neighborhoods, pro-HERO ads on Houston Black radio stations and hard hitting attacks to destroy the only card our haters had to play in the bathroom meme.""
'No personality'
But even ads featuring Houston NAACP president James Douglas endorsing the ordinance were not enough to erode critics' lead with black voters.
Douglas said he was hesitant to comment on what might have worked with black voters because he had not seen the results broken out by precinct.
""I'm not sure what supporters could have done,"" Douglas said. ""Most of the people I've talked to said it was all about the restroom fear. They literally see it as 'I don't want that to happen to someone that I know.'""
Councilman Jerry Davis, who represents the majority black District B that includes Fifth Ward and Acres Homes, said outreach in the black community was simply ""way too little, way too late.""
Davis is among the 11 council members who voted in favor of the law. As he visited polling sites in his district Tuesday, he said residents' skepticism about the ordinance had not budged during the past year.
""You can't win this debate at the polls; it's too late,"" Davis said. ""Voters were confused. They wanted to understand that this was an equal rights law, that it would help them. But instead they couldn't get this visual out of their heads of a man entering a woman's restroom. Opponents told that story over and over and over again until it was too late for Houston Unites.""
University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus said opponents were first out of the gates with their messaging, framing the debate around the bathroom issue, and supporters never caught up.
""The pro-HERO folks needed to have a public face much earlier than they did,"" Rottinghaus said. ""There was no personality to HERO, and I think that hurt the pro-HERO folks because it wasn't clear what people were voting in favor of.""",Houston Unites,1,1102,80.98,55.75,17.53,9.02,23.45,25.32,84.3,63.61,48.19,8.89,4.36,0.64,0.45,0.09,0.91,2,4.54,15.34,8.8,1.54,13.07,6.44,4.26,5.63,1.63,13.52,7.44,4.08,8.35,2.45,1.09,4.9,10.62,0.64,9.89,1.09,1.81,1.63,1.72,0.18,3.9,0,4.08,1.45,2.63,1.09,0,1.09,0.36,0.36,0,0,15.97,7.71,0.64,0,0.91,0.91,3.9,8.26,0.36,0,1.27,0.82,3.63,2.99,0.54,0.09,3.9,0.64,0.36,2.18,0.54,0.27,1,0.09,0,0,0,0,0.54,0.09,0,0.45,0.18,0.27,0.18,0.18,0,0.09,0.54,0.36,2.81,9.26,0.27,1.18,5.72,1.91,0,0.54,2.99,8.35,1.09,0.45,0.18,0.18,0,0,0,17.97,4.45,6.53,0,0,2.72,4.26,0,0.36,0,0.18,0.18,0.18,3.63,3.57,3.49,3.69,3.06,-3.95,-2.34,-0.89,-1.53,-2.4,0.36,0.91,0.27,0.64,2,0.09,1.09,0.09,0.54,0,0.36,0.18,1.91,0.45,0.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.45,1.85,16.76,136.12,1.09,235.93,0.27,145.19,1.27,190.56,0.64,117.97,-0.82,290.38,-0.09,326.68,0,136.12,-0.27,36.3,0.18,0,0,81.67,108.89,99.82,63.52,36.3,63.52,0.45,54.45,99.82,136.12,63.52,0,0,0,136.12,136.12,90.74,63.52,27.22,0,1.45,1,0.09,0.64,0.09,0,0,0.09,0.18,0,0.09,0.09,0.09,0,1
11/5/15,19,Politics,How Opponents of LGBT Rights Are Exploiting the Politics of Disgust - The rejection of an anti- discrimination ordinance in Houston marks the return of an old culture war tactic ,"The gay marriage movement succeeded by convincing people that gay men and women just wanted to be normal. Having lost that battle, the opponents of LGBT rights have made a partial comeback by turning their focus to transgender discrimination, bringing old fears of the abnormal and the deviant back to the forefront.
On Tuesday, voters in Houston overwhelmingly rejected a broad anti-discrimination ordinance by a whopping 62 percent to 38 percent margin after its opponents shamelessly pitched the measure as a vehicle for sexual predators to victimize young women. ""Any man at any time could enter a woman's bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day. ... Even registered sex offenders could follow women or young girls into the bathroom,"" warned one TV ad depicting a faceless man following a young uniformed school girl in into a bathroom stall and shutting the door. ""It would allowed troubled men to enter women's public bathrooms, showers, and locker rooms,"" former Houston Astros baseball star Lance Berkman said in a radio ad against the ordinance.
That message preyed on all kinds of base fears and stereotypes‚Äîthat trans people are disturbed freaks; that the world is crawling with sexual predators; and that women and girls must be shielded from men's private parts. The reality is that 17 states and more than 200 towns and cities broadly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity, including at public bathrooms. And there's no evidence that these laws are enabling sexual assault by sexual predators pretending to be transgendered. Violence against transgender people, on the other hand, is still distressingly real and on the rise.
The Houston officials supporting the law‚Äîincluding Annise Parker, the city's openly lesbian mayor‚Äînever intended the fight to be reduced to bathrooms in the first place. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) was intended to protect an extremely broad range of groups, barring discrimination against individuals based on ""sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy."" In the brief period last year when HERO was in effect‚Äîbefore the Texas Supreme Court intervened and forced the measure to be put on the ballot‚Äîfive of the complaints filed under the ordinance were about racial discrimination, five were about LGBT discrimination, and one was about gender discrimination.
Supporters of HERO tried to unite behind the broad message of anti-discrimination, garnering the support of everyone from Hillary Clinton to actress Sally Field. ""In the most diverse city in America, we believe that everyone should be treated fairly and equally under the law, no matter who they are,"" proclaimed Houston Unites, a local coalition that supported ordinance. The website featured minority business owners, disability rights advocates, and faith leaders who supported the anti-discrimination measure. But that generic message of ""diversity"" ultimately didn't seem to be enough to cut through the opposition's message about sexual deviants on the prowl.
Mara Keisling, executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality, says the fight should never have been reduced to the queston of bathroom access. At the same time, she believes that trans people themselves should have played a bigger role in the campaign. ""Trans people were very supportive of this ordinance in the one sense. I don't know they were engaged sufficiently by the campaign. I'm not blaming the campaign‚Äîwe weren't that engaged either,"" says Keisling, a trans-identified woman. But Keisling believes that the bigger problem was voters' lack of education and familiarity with trans people in their day-to-day lives. ""Trans visibility wasn't sufficient, and folks in Houston don't know us well enough to just know that this was a fear-mongering campaign about lies run by the same folks that just lost the marriage battle.""
Lou Weaver, a transgender activist at the forefront of the Houston fight, points out that the campaign did try to tell ordinary people's stories. Equality Texas, for example, released a video featuring a local Houston plumber talking to his coworker about coming out as a transgender man. But Weaver agrees that more needs to be done to bring transgender people into the mainstream. ""It's easy to demonize people we don't know, and not everyone has the privilege of knowing a transgender person,"" he says. ""We've got to bring it home."" Without a countervailing argument, the opposition was free not only to demonize transgender individuals, but also to focus on the parts that still tend to make people the most uncomfortable‚Äînamely, the private parts. Access to public accommodations‚Äîincluding bathrooms in restaurants and stores‚Äîis a real concern for trans people, who've regularly experienced harassment and assault when they've tried using gendered facilities. LGBT activists are currently fighting for those protections in Massachusetts. The state passed a law in 2011 that bans employer or housing discrimination based on gender identity, among other protected classes, but didn't extend that protection to public accommodations. Utah passed an LGBT anti-discrimination law in March that similarly excludes public accommodations. On the local level, transgender students have fought for the right to use school bathrooms and locker rooms. The larger problem is that there is still no federal law explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, though Democrats are currently pushing to add such protections.
The opposition has responded by applying the old tactics they used against gay men and women to another class of people who still haven't been normalized in the broader public eye. It's no longer socially or politically acceptable to speak of the horrors of gay sex, as anti-gay activists had done for decades. In fact, the fight for gay marriage succeed in large part by taking sex out of the equation, replacing it with images of loving parents and doting old couples. ""It was old-lady lesbians who we found were the best messengers,"" one advocate told The Atlantic. ""Nobody thought about sex when they saw them."" But despite the emergence of celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner, transgender people remain marginalized, and it is still socially and politically acceptable to portray them as dangerous, pathological deviants.
The moral panic isn't likely to go away any time soon, especially as the fight has spread to bathrooms in schools. The Obama administration has ordered an Illinois school to make accommodations for a transgender girl who wants to change in the girls' locker room; the feds have intervened in similar cases in California. A handful of states have already passed laws requiring schools to allow transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity. At the same time, conservatives in states like Wisconsin are trying to pass laws explicitly prohibiting such accommodations; similar measures have surfaced in Minnesota, Nevada, and Kentucky. And the pearl-clutching that was prevalent in Houston can be seen in those states, too. ""Girls should not have to risk being exposed to boys in locker rooms, changing rooms, and restrooms,"" an analyst for Focus on the Family told The New York Times.
As with the gay marriage fight, the antidote to such fear-mongering seems to be normalcy. ""I think the most important work for any trans person is the education we're doing with our families and our classmates and our coworkers‚Äîwhen they know us, they understand that we're human beings,"" says Keisling. The community is finding new ways to deliver that message: On Twitter, transgender activists have embraced a tongue-in-cheek hashtag to defuse the bathroom fight: #wejustneedtopee. They just want to do their business in peace and move on with their lives, like everyone else.",Houston Unites,1,1259,89.63,67.94,26.71,5.31,24.21,28.51,84.19,59.02,46.07,6.75,3.1,0.24,0.95,0,0.24,1.27,3.65,14.54,8.82,0.87,15.01,6.99,3.73,4.69,1.59,13.58,6.51,2.46,7.31,1.99,0.64,4.69,11.91,1.27,10.64,1.83,1.83,1.43,1.11,0.48,4.21,0,4.85,1.51,3.34,1.03,0.16,0.87,0.56,0.16,0.08,0,16.76,7.23,0.64,0,2.62,0.87,1.83,9.85,0.79,0.08,1.51,0.79,1.59,1.27,0.16,0.16,3.42,0.48,0.71,1.99,0.24,0.16,3.81,0.32,0.08,0.16,0,0,1.99,0.08,0,0.32,0.24,0.24,0.16,0.32,0,0.16,0.64,0,4.92,8.1,0.48,1.51,5.8,0.4,0,0.08,2.78,3.97,3.73,0.32,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,16.28,4.37,5.96,0,0,2.07,3.89,0,0.16,0,0.32,0,0.16,4.3,4.3,3.7,3.76,3.65,-4.55,-2.1,-1.31,-2.01,-2.53,0.4,0.64,0.08,1.11,1.11,0.64,0.64,0,0.4,0,0.48,0.87,1.19,0.08,0.32,0,0,0.08,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,0,2.68,1.6,17.33,119.14,1.03,349.48,-0.79,214.46,1.99,190.63,1.51,119.14,-1.03,246.23,-0.24,317.71,0,87.37,-0.4,23.83,0.24,7.94,0,63.54,55.6,119.14,55.6,7.94,95.31,0.16,166.8,142.97,7.94,15.89,0,0,0,55.6,39.71,158.86,301.83,39.71,0,1.11,1,0.64,0.71,0.16,0,0.16,0.16,0.56,0,0.64,0.48,1.59,0,1

The little girl's attire of black Mary Jane shoes and bobby socks - utterly innocent and vulnerable - was a happy coincidence.
They were the central characters of a 30-second ad with one message: No men in women's bathrooms.
The commercial, with its stark black and white images, ominous soundtrack and spine-chilling graphics, galvanized the opposition to Houston's equal rights ordinance. The day after voters rejected HERO, the ad man who created the television spot was celebrating.
""It always feels great to win,"" said Jeff Norwood, a longtime Republican political consultant based in Austin.
Even before Campaign for Houston leaders brought Norwood in to create the ad, they had decided to make ""bathroom safety"" the focus of their campaign to repeal HERO, said spokesman Jared Woodfill. Norwood's job was to hook voters on a gut level.
The ad did that.
It opens with a man walking into a women's restroom, his face hidden in the shadows. A faucet drips. Fluorescent lights shudder. A little girl skips in. As the music moans and shrieks, the man confronts the child. A door slams shut.
Flashing across the screen, graphics warn of ""registered sex offenders.""
""Voters don't respond to bland, wishy-washy messages,"" said Norwood, who served as county judge in Midland County before founding Anthem Media. ""We were clear and concise. We didn't sugarcoat it.""
It took half a day to shoot the commercial. About a week to get it on the air.
The actor was intentionally faceless to heighten the tension and wearing male clothing to illustrate what HERO opponents maintained would be the consequences of the ordinance.
The 7-year-old portraying the victim showed up for the shoot in Mary Janes and bobby socks. ""We were lucky,"" Norwood said.
The ad, said Norwood, shifted the narrative of the election away from equal rights to bathroom safety. He brushed off criticism that the commercial was misleading and unfairly characterized transgender people as sexual predators.
""The only misleading campaign was the pro side that tried to make this about other issues and denied the fact that bathroom safety was the real issue in the campaign,"" Norwood said. ""I think it correctly portrayed the dangers women and girls would face had the ordinance passed.""
Woodfill likened Norwood's commercial to one of the most famous political ads in modern times, a 30-second spot that depicts a freckle-faced girl counting the petals on a daisy. As she reaches 10, the numbers shift to a countdown, ending with the detonation of a nuclear bomb. Broadcast only once, it was seen as a pivotal factor in Lyndon Johnson's landslide win in the 1964 presidential election.
In both ads, the looming sense of peril tapped in to voters' fears - and drove them to the polls. ""This one will always be on my favorite list,"" said Norwood.",Campaign for Houston ,1,475,96.85,75.8,9.02,15.52,14.39,25.68,78.11,58.11,43.79,6.32,2.95,0.42,0.63,0,0.63,0.84,3.37,16.63,12.63,1.89,13.89,4.63,2.53,4.42,0.63,11.79,6.32,3.58,6.74,0.84,1.68,4.63,5.47,1.05,4.42,0.84,1.68,0.42,0,0.63,0.84,0,6.32,2.95,3.37,1.26,0.42,0.84,0.63,0.21,0,0,13.26,6.53,0,0,1.05,1.26,2.53,7.58,0,0,1.68,2.11,2.53,2.11,0,0.42,2.53,0.84,0,0.84,0.84,0,1.26,0,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0,0,0,0.42,0.42,0,0,0.42,2.11,0.42,2.11,11.58,0.42,1.47,5.68,2.74,0.84,0.63,2.53,7.58,0.84,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,20.63,6.95,5.05,0,0,2.11,6.53,0,0.63,0,0.42,0.21,0,3.3,3.22,3.01,3.13,2.92,-2.95,-0.17,-0.69,-1.02,-0.92,0.42,0.42,0.84,0.42,0.84,0.42,0,0,0.42,0,0.42,0.21,0.42,0.21,0.42,0,0,0,0,0,0.21,0,0,0,1.74,1.85,15.77,42.11,0.42,336.84,-0.63,189.47,1.26,147.37,0.63,21.05,-0.21,294.74,0.84,231.58,0,126.32,0,0,0,0,0,0,63.16,42.11,84.21,63.16,105.26,0.21,126.32,105.26,63.16,42.11,0,0,0,147.37,21.05,147.37,126.32,21.05,21.05,1.89,1,0,0.21,0,0,0,0,0.21,1.05,0,0,0.21,0.63,1

11/4/15,19,Opinion,Houston soundly rejects equal rights ordinance ,"HOUSTON (AP) &mdash; The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was soundly rejected Tuesday by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. The defeat came after a nearly 18-month battle in the nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest city that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In the months leading up to Tuesday&rsquo;s vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women&rsquo;s restrooms. The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000. Supporters said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay and championed the ordinance, led a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston in a chant that referenced the ordinance&rsquo;s nickname, HERO, yelling, &ldquo;A hero fights for justice.&rdquo; Still, the future of the ordinance looked uncertain. Parker is finishing her final two-year term, and it&rsquo;s unclear if the next mayor and city council will revisit the issue. Parker, a Democrat, and other supporters described the &ldquo;bathroom ordinance&rdquo; campaign as &ldquo;fear mongering.&rdquo; The state&rsquo;s top two elected leaders &mdash; Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans &mdash; praised the defeat, with Abbott saying voters &ldquo;showed values still matter.&rdquo; Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, described the ordinance as &ldquo;pandering to political correctness.&rdquo; He said it was only about allowing men to enter women&rsquo;s restrooms and locker rooms &ldquo;defying,&rdquo; in his words, &ldquo;common sense and common decency.&rdquo; Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday&rsquo;s defeat of the ordinance made Houston &ldquo;a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct
stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.&rdquo; The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot. Tuesday&rsquo;s referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston&rsquo;s religious community. Kristen Capps, a Houston attorney who supported the ordinance, remained optimistic after Tuesday&rsquo;s defeat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like every civil rights movement.

11/4/15,19,News,Houston voters reject LGBT nondiscrimination ,"HOUSTON - An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Supporters of the ordinance had said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents of the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance had called this ""bathroom ordinance strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ordinance also had received support from other members of Houston's religious community.

Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.

11/4/15,19,USA,Houston votes down LGBT rights ordinance over bathroom clause ,"The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was solidly rejected Tuesday, but Houston Mayor Annise Parker isn‚Äôt giving up on LGBT rights.
Nicknamed HERO, the ordinance would have established nondiscrimination protections for people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender in public businesses such as restaurants and hotels. The measure would also have banned discrimination in city employment and city services. But the initiative failed to garner enough support from voters.
The ordinance was initially approved in May 2014, but a lawsuit that ultimately reached Texas Supreme Court resulted in a ruling forcing the city of Houston to repeal the ordinance or allow city residents to vote on the measure.
Though the vote revealed 61 percent disapproval, Ms. Parker, who is one of the first openly gay mayors of a major US city, is determined to continue the fight for justice.
""I guarantee that justice in Houston will prevail. This ordinance, you have not seen the last of. We're united. We will prevail,"" Parker said.
But as Parker approaches the end of her term, it‚Äôs unclear whether the measure will pass before she leaves office. She appears to be one of the few elected leaders supporting the ordinance. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick argued the ordinance ‚Äúwas never about equality ‚Äì that is already the law. It was about allowing men to enter women‚Äôs restrooms and locker rooms ‚Äî defying common sense and common decency,‚Äù according to the Texas Tribune.
In addition to anti-discriminatory measures, the ordinance would allow residents to file complaints if they felt discriminated against and guilty violators would be subject to fines up to $5,000. But it was the public bathroom clause that most opponents attacked, stating the ordinance would allow ‚Äúsexual predators to use women‚Äôs restrooms.‚Äù
Furthermore, though religious institutions were exempt, many opponents cited infringement of religious beliefs as cause for rejecting the ordinance.
Supporters released a written statement Tuesday night to the Houston Chronicle: ""We are disappointed with today's outcome, but our work to secure nondiscrimination protections for all hard-working Houstonians will continue. No one should have to live with the specter of discrimination hanging over them. Everyone should have the freedom to work hard, earn a decent living and provide for themselves and their families.""

11/4/15,19,USA,Houston 'bathroom bill': What it says about transgender issues in US ,"The defeat of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance Tuesday points to the growing need for a compassionate dialogue around transgenderism, some observers suggest.
The measure, which offered broad nondiscrimination protections to gay and transgender people, among others, fell by a wide margin in a city referendum.
While supporters of the measure were disappointed at its failure, they were perhaps even more dismayed by the tone of the debate leading up to the vote. Critics rallied support against the ordinance by saying that it allowed sexual predators and mentally disturbed men to use women‚Äôs bathrooms under the guise of being transgender. The claim, supporters said, was outrageous and based on a radically incorrect view of transgender people.
With transgenderism becoming more open, the issue of what public bathrooms transgender individuals should use has played out in school districts nationwide. The Obama administration has called for transgender children in public schools to be able to choose the restroom they wish, but that policy has caused angst in states and local districts.
The first step toward finding resolution is a sense of empathy, says Erik Fogg, founder of Something to Consider (STC), a Massachusetts-based organization that seeks to promote productive dialogue on divisive issues.
‚ÄúUltimately, for almost everyone, politics is driven by an emotional reaction to something,‚Äù Mr. Fogg says. ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt empathize [with someone], you can‚Äôt care.‚Äù
Specifically, the Houston ordinance protected a range of groups ‚Äì from military service members to the elderly ‚Äì against discrimination in a range of fields ‚Äì from city contracts to private housing. But the debate to defeat it turned on perceptions of transgender individuals, who were also granted protected status under the ordinance.
Led by the city‚Äôs religious community, opponents claimed the transgender protections would put women and children in public restrooms in danger.
‚ÄúThe voters clearly understand that this proposition was never about equality ‚Äì that is already the law,‚Äù Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt was about allowing men to enter women‚Äôs restrooms and locker rooms ‚Äì defying common sense and common decency.‚Äù
The argument shows the gap that will need to be bridged for a more constructive debate on the issue, Fogg notes.
Conservative media outlets have reported that boys claiming to be transgender have harassed girls in school bathrooms. But liberal watchdog groups such as Media Matters have sought to debunk such allegations, arguing that no incidents of harassment have occurred in schools and other venues that have adopted consistent nondiscrimination policies.
‚ÄúPeople need more accurate information, not fear-based horror stories,‚Äù says Robyn Ochs, a campus speaker who focuses on identity, sexuality, and gender.
But advocates also need to employ ‚Äúthe charm offensive,‚Äù Fogg says, because for conservatives opposed to nondiscrimination measures, the prevailing opinion is that ‚Äúif you‚Äôre going to change your sex, it‚Äôs not the law‚Äôs job to jump in and do backflips for you.‚Äù
‚ÄúProgressives have to make [the issue] emotionally positive and resonant rather than frightening.‚Äù Polls suggest that public opinion is slowly moving toward tolerance and acceptance. More than 70 percent of Americans say transgender people face a lot of discrimination in the United States, and about the same number favor laws that would protect gay and lesbian people from job discrimination, according to a Public Religion Research Institute survey published in July.
The process, Fogg acknowledges, will take time. ‚ÄúYou work hard for it for 10 years and might see something happen,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how political change works, that‚Äôs how cultural change works.‚Äù",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,579,90.88,68.31,16.62,10.07,20.68,30.4,83.94,57.17,45.08,6.91,1.9,0,0,1.04,0.17,0.35,5.01,13.13,8.12,0.52,15.37,6.39,3.28,4.84,1.04,13.64,5.7,2.76,6.22,1.21,1.55,3.8,12.61,0.52,11.92,2.25,2.59,1.73,1.55,0.17,3.45,0,4.49,1.38,2.42,2.25,0.17,1.38,0.52,0.52,0.17,0,16.75,8.12,1.38,0.35,1.55,0.69,3.45,8.29,0,0,0.86,0.86,2.07,2.07,0,0,4.66,0.17,0.35,3.8,0,0.35,2.94,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0,1.04,0.17,0.35,0,0,0,0,1.21,0.17,4.49,8.29,0.52,1.38,5.53,0.35,0,0.52,2.07,2.94,3.63,1.38,0,0,0,0,0,17.96,5.01,6.39,0,0,1.73,4.84,0,0.69,0,0.69,0,0.35,4.21,4.43,3.62,3.98,3.46,-2.95,-1.87,0.12,-1.14,-2.02,0.86,1.9,0.69,0.35,0.86,0.52,0.86,0,0.69,0,0.52,0.52,0.69,0,1.04,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,2.22,2.26,18.32,241.8,2.07,310.88,0,241.8,2.25,207.25,1.55,120.9,-1.04,310.88,-1.21,310.88,0,172.71,-0.17,34.54,0.35,51.81,0,51.81,69.08,189.98,51.81,51.81,51.81,0.17,138.17,86.36,0,34.54,17.27,0.17,0,69.08,17.27,103.63,224.53,17.27,34.54,1.55,1,0.5,0.33,0.17,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.5,0.33,1.49,0,1
11/4/15,19,A,ELECTION 2015 - RIGHTS ORDINANCE: Bathroom issue key as protections rejected ,"Houston voters soundly rejected the city's embattled equal rights ordinance Tuesday in one of the most heated local political contests in recent memory that drew national scrutiny and sparked months of impassioned back-and-forth about social issues, particularly transgender rights.
The decision leaves Houston the only major city in Texas and one of the few nationwide without some form of a nondiscrimination law. It also marks the third time Houston voters have rejected protections or benefits for gay residents, as they did in 1985 and 2001.
The equal rights ordinance, known by its acronym HERO, would have extended local protections against discrimination to 15 groups, ranging from veterans to pregnant women to gay and transgender residents, with the latter proving the biggest flashpoint for conservative opponents of the law. In recent weeks, the contest played out on a national stage, drawing comments from the White House and top state officials as well as media attention from a slew of top outlets.
Critics pinned their campaign on the controversial claim that the law would allow men dressed as women, including sexual predators, to enter women's restrooms. Opponents' most talked-about ad featured a man bursting into a bathroom stall occupied by a young girl as ominous music played in the background.
Anti-HERO campaign spokesman Jared Woodfill said Tuesday's results proved the messaging worked, calling it a ""David vs. Goliath"" battle.
""If anything is scary about this ordinance, it's the truth,"" Woodfill said. ""All we did is a identify a very scary reality, it wasn't a scare tactic, it was a dangerous truth that Mayor Parker tried to hide from the public.""
Supporters of the law, who more than tripled their opponent's fundraising efforts with a nearly $3 million haul, warned that Tuesday's vote would have wide-ranging repercussions. Mayor Annise Parker at a watch party Tuesday night with supporters said, ""I absolutely fear there will be a direct economic backlash.""
Greater Houston Partnership President Bob Harvey released a statement saying he was ""disappointed by the defeat.""
Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major U.S. city, also called opponents' demonization of transgender residents ""personally revolting.""
""They just kept spewing an ugly wad of lies from our TV screens and from our pulpits,"" she said.
Term-limited Parker said she would not attempt to pass a new version of the law during her final two months in office, leaving that decision to the next mayor.
The two mayoral candidates who qualified for the runoff Tuesday differ on the law, with State Rep. Sylvester Turner backing it and former mayor of Kemah Bill King saying he doesn't support the ordinance as written.
The ordinance banned discrimination based not just on gender identity and sexual orientation, but also 13 classes already protected under federal law: sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, religion, disability, pregnancy and genetic information, as well as family, marital or military status.
Businesses that serve the public, private employers, housing and city contracting were all subject to the law and faced up to $5,000 in fines for violations. Religious institutions, however, were exempt. Opponents' singular focus on bathroom access came to consume both campaigns, forcing supporters to repeatedly respond to allegations even as they sought to broaden the conversation to other protected classes.
Supporters failed to come up with a coherent message and should have focused on the possible economic ramifications of failing to uphold the law, said Rice University political scientist Bob Stein.
""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the economic argument was a salient argument,"" Stein said. ""Would they have been able to win this with that messaging? I don't know. But it would not have been as lopsided and someone could have resurrected the issue at council with a smaller margin.""
Last week, supporters netted a big endorsement from Democratic Presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton and a statement from President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden saying they were ""confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.""
But the bathroom issue remained at the fore, with Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick peppering the airwaves that told voters ""no woman should have to share a public restroom or locker room with a man.""
Patrick cheered the results Tuesday. ""I don't care how much money you spend,"" Patrick said. ""But you can't spend enough money to try to fool the public into voting for something that defies their value system, their decency meter and what they were brought up with. You're brought up to respect women, not to follow them into the bathroom.""
The ordinance did not mention bathrooms and nor did it offer any protections to anyone who commits a crime in a bathroom or anywhere else. It also did not change a longstanding city law that bars someone from entering a restroom of the opposite sex with the ""intent to cause a disturbance.""
But supporters failed to get out ahead of the bathroom issue, said University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus.
""The pro-HERO folks didn't realize early enough where the problems would be and didn't do enough to negate the arguments that were likely to come,"" he said. ""Only late in the game did we see significant public support from notables from the Democratic party or from Hollywood. It was all in the fourth quarter, when the game was already won by halftime by the anti-folks.""
The battle over the ordinance started almost 18 months ago, when Parker first took the law to committee and immediately drew pushback from local conservatives, especially Christian conservatives. After City Council passed the law 11-6 in May 2014, opponents vowed to force a repeal referendum.
Critics claimed they collected thousands more signatures than needed to trigger a vote, but then-City Attorney David Feldman said they fell short of the needed 17,249 because of collection errors.
Opponents sued the city, and a more than year-long legal battle followed - including an incident in which the city subpoenaed local pastors' sermons as part of a broader discovery request but then withdrew the request amid national backlash.
In July, the state's highest court rejected a district judge's ruling siding with Parker and Feldman and instead found that the city should have accepted the repeal petition. The court ordered City Council to either repeal the ordinance or send it to voters. In August, council opted for the latter.

11/4/15,19,B,CIty council - Seven council races head to runoff amid heavy turnout - Equal rights ordinance is cited in upheaval as more conservatives come out to the polls - Council races are costly for 2 at- large seats - DAY- Wednesday ,"For more images from Election Day, go to Chron.com/ElectionPhotos Get analysis of the results at HoustonChronicle.com
Seven city council elections are on track to join the mayoral race in a December runoff, after a crowded field in three key races split voters and four incumbents faced insurgent challenges, some tied to the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
Riding what some observers and politicians regarded as high Republican turnout related to opposing the equal rights proposal, Mike Knox was clearly out front among eight candidates vying for the open At-Large 1 council seat.
""Obviously Prop. 1 has drawn out a number of conservative voters, and that is good for me,"" Knox said. Knox was expected to face Georgia Provost, making her second run at securing a council seat.
Because of term limits, two district seats and two at-large positions of the 16 council spots were up for grabs Tuesday night. But with HERO on the ballot, At-Large 2 incumbent David Robinson faced a runoff with a candidate aligned with defeating the equal rights ordinance.
In a five-person contest, Robinson was being tested most by Willie R. Davis, a pastor and foe of HERO. Davis filed on the last day of candidate eligibility, though he disputed last month his candidacy was related to the equal rights vote.
Robinson was the only candidate in his contest to clearly state his support for HERO.
""There is no great surprise we are going to be working into the second week of December,"" Robinson said, noting the turnout caused by the equal rights ordinance. ""Prop. 1 carried a huge surge with it.""
Incumbent Mike Laster, meanwhile, had his District J election upended by HERO. Laster faced a strong challenge from Sharpstown Civic Association President Jim Bigham, who led Manny Barrera slightly. Barrera, a former teacher, chose to face Laster on the advice of Houston Community College Trustee Dave Wilson, as an anti-HERO candidate.
Other anti-HERO candidates were not as successful. District C council member Ellen Cohen easily defeated Carl Jarvis - who ran in direct opposition to Cohen's support for the equal rights ordinance.
What remains to be seen is whether the debate over the equal rights ordinance carries into the runoff.
""I don't think it is fully resolved yet, in what that might mean,"" Robinson said, noting some of the candidates in many races might want to keep the issue alive to stoke turnout a second time.
Tight contests
In a closely watched race in District H - where Mayor Pro-Tem Ed Gonzalez was term-limited - former Houston Independent School District board member Karla Cisneros was leading. Unlike races dominated by HERO, Cisneros said she was proud of her more grass-roots campaign. ""We heard from people all day, and I did an awful lot of block walking and people said they liked that,"" she said.
Cisneros appeared headed to a runoff with Jason Cisneroz, who had backing from Gonzalez and another former District H councilman - Adrian Garcia, who came up short in his own mayoral run. Cisneroz, however, was only narrowly leading Roland Chavez, making the contest uncertain as of Tuesday night.
Amanda Edwards was leading six others to claim the At-Large 4 seat but didn't have enough votes to avoid a runoff, probably with Roy Morales. Laurie Robinson was close behind Morales.
In the only other council race not involving an incumbent, Greg Travis beat Houston Community College trustee Sandie Mullins Moger for the District G seat in a head-to-head contest.
Incumbents split
As Travis celebrated, two additional sitting council members faced the prospect of losing their seats. Incumbents Jack Christie and Richard Nguyen appeared headed for a runoff, as other council members cruised to victory.
It was a role-reversal in District F for Nguyen, who knocked off Al Hoang in a surprise upset in 2013. This time, Steve Le held a lead on Nguyen, forcing him to a December contest.
Christie was close to avoiding a runoff, but could not get across the line, thanks to strong showings from Sharon Moses and Philippe Nassif. Moses held a sufficient lead over Nassif to face Christie in December.
In races not as affected by the equal rights ordinance, similar issues dominated the elections. Restoring order to city finances while delivering improved services, notably road and flooding projects, topped the to-do lists of would-be officeholders.
That discussion is expected to carry to December races, Knox said.
""The voters will have to make a decision on where they want the city to go,"" he said. ""Stay distracted by wants and desires or get to business.""
The three most competitive races - those for District G, At-Large 1 and At-Large 4 - were also the most costly for candidates. The two at-large races, largely because of the dearth of candidates in each and the citywide nature of the campaigns, led to more than $250,000 in campaign spending in each election.
More than $150,000 came from a political action committee supporting Tom McCasland, former CEO of the Harris County Housing Authority, who finished fourth in the crowded At-Large 1 election.
Dwight Boykins, Dave Martin and Larry Green were not challenged for their council seats, while Brenda Stardig, Jerry Davis, Robert Gallegos and Michael Kubosh easily defeated their opponents.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,866,95.54,42.77,31.56,46.38,19.68,27.25,74.83,53.35,41.45,4.85,3.23,0.35,0.23,0,1.39,0.58,1.62,13.74,7.85,3,14.78,4.5,2.08,4.39,0.92,11.2,4.73,5.77,7.97,1.39,1.96,5.43,9.58,0.69,8.55,1.04,1.39,0.69,0.81,0.46,4.27,0,4.16,2.66,0.92,1.15,0.35,0.23,0,0,0.12,0,9.82,3.46,0.46,0.23,0.46,0.58,1.39,5.77,0,0,0.46,0.92,4.39,4.39,0,0,3.93,0.23,0.12,3.12,0.46,0.12,0.81,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,0.23,0.46,0.58,0.35,0.35,0,0.12,0.58,0,3.35,9.35,0.46,1.85,6.58,0.69,0.12,0.23,3.46,6.24,1.27,1.39,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,16.97,5.31,6.47,0,0,0.35,4.85,0,0.12,0,0,0.23,0.12,2.93,3.27,3.02,3.2,2.33,-1.58,-0.62,0.33,-0.38,-0.15,1.5,0.69,0,0,1.85,0,0.23,0,0.69,0,0.12,0,0.92,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.95,1.54,13.6,161.66,1.39,219.4,0.92,150.12,0.81,150.12,0.69,46.19,-0.35,450.35,0.69,415.7,0,196.3,0,34.64,0.35,0,0,23.09,69.28,103.93,11.55,57.74,103.93,0.35,150.12,46.19,34.64,69.28,0,0,0,46.19,0,115.47,0,11.55,11.55,0.58,1,0,0.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
11/4/15,19,State,Defeat could have broad impact ,"HOUSTON ‚Äî The landslide defeat of a nondiscrimination ordinance in Houston has stunned LGBT-rights activists across the nation. They're now bracing for their opponents in other states to seize on the successful tactic of stoking fears over transgender people's access to public restrooms.
By a 61-to-39-percent margin, voters in America's fourth largest city on Tuesday rejected a broad equal-rights ordinance ‚Äî extending protections in employment, housing and public spaces on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender identity and other categories. Opponents prevailed with a campaign that dubbed the measure ""the bathroom ordinance"" and raised the specter of male sexual predators invading women's restrooms.
The outcome was ""a devastating blow to equality,"" said the Human Rights Campaign, a national group advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
""It's almost unbelievable that this could happen in a city like Houston,"" said the campaign's president, Chad Griffin. ""But make no mistake: If we don't double down today, we'll face the same thing again and again in cities across the nation.""
The ordinance lost despite strong support from many major businesses, and despite its supporters' arguments that serious problems with bathroom access have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states and scores of cities that have banned discrimination against transgender people in public accommodations.
""This is a national game-changer,"" said Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values Action, which opposed the ordinance. He described the result as ""a massive victory for common sense, safety and religious freedom.""
The outcome in Houston was swiftly seized upon by opposing sides in California, where the legislature passed a law in 2013 allowing transgender students to participate in activities and use facilities corresponding to their gender identity. Opponents are gathering signatures for a 2016 ballot measure that would overturn the law and require people to use facilities that correspond with their ""biological sex.""
Karen England of Privacy for All, which is promoting the ballot measure, noted that in both Houston and California there were efforts to prevent a public vote on the nondiscrimination issue.
""Houston elites were afraid to let the voters vote, and they had good reason to be,"" England said. ""We think California elites have similar reason to be afraid.""
England's group and its allies are seeking to collect 500,000 signatures by Nov. 20 to ensure they have enough valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
A coalition of gay-rights supporters who back California's 2013 law warned that the state may face a campaign echoing the one in Houston.
""We fully expect our opponents to use the same misinformation and scare tactics in California that they used in Houston,"" said Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California. ""Since they can no longer stop same-sex couples from getting married, this is the next page in their attempts to discriminate against the LGBT community.""
In Houston, there was some second-guessing on Wednesday as to whether supporters of the ordinance ‚Äî including the lesbian mayor, Annise Parker ‚Äî could have mounted a more effective campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, said the campaign failed to counteract the ""bathroom ordinance"" message with arguments that might have better resonated with voters, particularly African-Americans who turned out in large numbers.
Stein said voters might have supported the ordinance if persuaded that its defeat could mean potential economic losses, including companies deciding not to relocate to Houston or organizations deciding not to hold meetings or conventions in the city.
Ordinance supporters, including the Greater Houston Partnership, an influential business group, had warned that defeat of the measure might trigger economic boycotts or endanger plans for Houston to host the Super Bowl in 2017 or the NCAA Final Four in 2016. But the message that supporters pushed in advertising focused mainly on protections against discrimination.
""They had allies in the African-American community, who are traditionally Democratic and progressive voters but did not buy into the argument that gays and more specifically transgender (people) are a group that needs to be protected,"" Stein said.
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, described the result as ""sad for Houston.""
""I fear this will have stained Houston's reputation as a tolerant, welcoming, global city,"" she said. ""And I absolutely fear that there will be a direct, economic backlash as a result of this ordinance going into defeat.""
The NFL said the ordinance's defeat will not affect plans for the 2017 Super Bowl.
""We will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events,"" the NFL said. ""Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.""
Nationally, nondiscrimination laws have become the LGBT-rights movement's top priority now that same-sex marriage is legal in every state.
A proposed federal nondiscrimination law is given no chance of passage any time soon because of Republican opposition, so activists are waging local and state-level campaigns. Frequently, the most visceral issue that arises is transgender people's access to public restrooms, and in some cases public schools have become the battleground.
In Palatine, Illinois, for example, school officials are at odds with the U.S. Education Department after being told they're violating federal law by denying a transgender student unrestricted access to a girls' high school locker room.

11/4/15,19,News,Ohio says ‚Äòno‚Äô to legalizing marijuana ,"Ohio voters soundly rejected a marijuana initiative Tuesday that would have legalized recreational and medicinal use of the drug, and would have limited commercial growing to a small group of investors who drafted and promoted the measure.
The initiative was failing 65 percent to 35 percent, with more than three-quarters of precincts reporting.
‚ÄúIssue 3 has been soundly defeated!‚Äù Ohioans Against Marijuana Monopolies crowed on Twitter. ‚ÄúNo marijuana monopolies in this state!‚Äù
Four other states, including Washington, and the District of Columbia have already legalized the recreational sale of marijuana, which is still a federal crime. Ohio would have been the first state in the Midwest to do so.
But along with opposition from anti-drug groups and state elected officials, Ohio‚Äôs unorthodox initiative drew discomfort from some legalization supporters.
Opponents alleged that Issue 3 would have effectively set up a monopoly by limiting commercial marijuana growth to 10 preselected plots of land owned by the entrepreneurs behind the measure.
A group of 24 investors backing the measure included former NBA star Oscar Robertson, descendants of President William Howard Taft and former boy-band celebrity Nick Lachey.
The ‚ÄúResponsibleOhio‚Äù legalization campaign was driven by political consultant Ian James, who acknowledged he would profit from the measure.
State legislators seeking to derail Issue 3 had presented voters with an ‚Äúantimonopoly‚Äù initiative, Issue 2, designed to nullify the marijuana initiative and ban special-interest groups from creating constitutional amendments for financial gain. Generally, under Ohio law, whichever ballot measure receives more votes prevails.
The vote for the antimonopoly initiative was much closer. It was leading, 52 percent to 48 percent, with 76 percent of precincts reporting.
The defeat of the marijuana measure was the first such loss for a recreational legalization initiative since 2012, and the first loss for marijuana advocates more generally since Florida rejected medical marijuana last year, according to John Hudak, a fellow with the Brookings Institute.
In a statement after the vote, Tom Angell of the pro-legalization group the Marijuana Majority called Issue 3 a ‚Äúflawed measure‚Äù that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt represent what voters wanted.
The measure would have imposed a 15 percent tax on gross revenues of growing operations and a 5 percent tax on gross revenues of retail marijuana stores, plus annual licensing fees.
Fifty-five percent of the taxes would have been distributed to cities and townships and 30 percent to counties for infrastructure and public safety purposes. The remaining 15 percent would have gone to the marijuana commission.
‚ÄòAirbnb proposition‚Äô behind in S.F. Proposition F, the contentious San Francisco ballot measure that would impose tighter restrictions on short-term housing rental services such as San Francisco-based Airbnb, was losing Tuesday night.
According to the city‚Äôs election website, the measure was behind, 58 percent to 42 percent, with about 91,000 ballots counted.
If passed, the measure would cap rentals to 75 days a year, whether or not they are hosted (meaning that the resident is at home during the renter‚Äôs stay). Current city law limits rentals to 90 days a year for unhosted rentals, while hosted rentals face no such limit.
Proposition F would also allow ‚Äúinterested parties‚Äù such as neighbors or landlords to sue short-term rental companies such as VRBO and Airbnb if they violate the new rules. Airbnb had raised more than $8 million to oppose the measure and put up a series of controversial billboards that touted the $12 million the company has generated in city hotel tax revenue.
The costly ballot fight became an emblem of the widening inequities that define today‚Äôs San Francisco, where the revved-up tech economy and dearth of housing have driven the median price of a one-bedroom apartment to $4,000 a month.
Opponents had criticized it as a clumsily crafted scapegoat for anxieties over a housing crisis with much broader causes than short- term rental housing.
The measure was one of a number on the ballot targeting the housing crisis.
Proposition I took aim at the Mission District, where displacement has been particularly pronounced. It would place a moratorium on market-rate housing development here for at least 18 months while a ‚Äúneighborhood stabilization plan‚Äù is crafted to ensure affordable housing is created. It, too, was losing in early returns.
Voters. however, appeared to be giving the thumbs up to Proposition A, a $310-million affordable housing bond heavily backed by Mayor Ed Lee, who has presided over the boom and ran virtually unopposed for a second term.
Houston rejected LGBT rights proposal
Houston voters rejected a controversial measure Tuesday that would have barred discrimination against gays and transgender people in the wake of an 18-month battle that pitted advocates of gay rights against those who believed they were defending religious liberty.
The vote had been expected to be close. But with about 30 percent of precincts reporting, the measure was trailing badly, 62 percent to 38 percent, and The Associated Press called the election for foes of the measure.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was initially approved by the City Council in May 2014. But opponents sued. In July, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the city to either repeal it or place the measure on the ballot.
Texas is one of 28 states that do not have statewide nondiscrimination protections ‚Äî although major cities have adopted policies, including Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio. Of the other 22 states, 17 bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and four offer limited protections.
Supporters, including Mayor Annise Parker, the first lesbian mayor of a major U.S. city; NAACP officials, pastors and business leaders, say the measure would offer increased protections for 15 groups, including gay and transgender people.
Political analysts have said the measure enjoyed early support. But conservative opponents reached out to minorities and eroded that support. Much hinged on turnout, which was expected to be high because of a heated race to replace Parker, who is stepping down because of term limits.
Conservative leaders also campaigned and spoke out against the ordinance, including a coalition of pastors, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and former Houston Astro Lance Berkman. Opponents say the measure, which they call Proposition 1 or the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance,‚Äù infringes on their religious beliefs and poses a public-health risk by allowing transgender women into women‚Äôs restrooms.
Parker and her supporters said Houston would lose tourism and convention business if the city had to repeal the ordinance and became known for intolerance, just as a backlash in Indiana over a religious-objections law led to convention cancellations there.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1088,95.27,42.76,9.35,8.3,20.53,33,79.23,52.76,42.28,3.31,1.19,0.09,0,0,0.18,0.46,2.11,13.79,9.47,4.5,13.97,6.25,1.93,5.97,0.46,10.11,4.69,5.97,6.53,0.64,1.75,4.23,8,0.18,7.63,0.55,1.19,1.47,0.92,0.09,3.22,0,3.31,1.01,2.3,0.37,0.09,0.28,0.09,0,0,0,8.18,3.4,0.28,0,1.29,0.09,0.74,4.23,0.09,0,0.37,0.09,3.22,3.03,0,0.18,7.81,0.46,1.38,2.76,3.4,0.46,2.48,0.28,0,0,0,1.1,0.55,0,0,0.37,0.09,0.28,0.37,0,0,0.18,1.29,0.28,2.85,6.43,0.28,0.64,4.96,0.18,0.28,0.28,3.03,5.15,1.19,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.07,4.96,5.42,0,0.18,0.64,3.86,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,3.5,3.52,3.17,3.6,2.8,-2.57,-1.54,-0.27,-1.96,-1.65,0.37,0.55,0.09,0.18,0.64,0.28,0.92,0,0.37,0,0.18,0.37,1.01,0.28,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,1.06,15.44,55.15,0.46,211.4,-0.55,64.34,0.55,137.87,0.83,137.87,-1.38,321.69,0.28,441.18,0,147.06,0.18,45.96,0.46,0,0,18.38,119.49,101.1,45.96,27.57,82.72,0,73.53,55.15,9.19,36.76,0,0,0,64.34,27.57,82.72,55.15,18.38,0,0.92,1,0.18,0.45,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,0.18,0.18,0.27,0.09,1
11/4/15,19,National,Rape threat roils Houston ballot campaign on transgender bathroom access ,"The campaign over a Houston ballot measure on transgender rights has been hit by an apparent rape threat against a former Miss Texas USA contestant who has campaigned against the proposal.
Angela Zatopek posted a video Sunday showing a screenshot from Facebook in which a man who supports the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance says in a message that he cannot wait for it to pass ""so I can dress up like a woman and follow you around and rape you in bathrooms.""
A Houston native, Ms. Zatopek became a public face of the campaign after appearing in an ad last month urging a ""no"" vote on Proposition 1, which would let people use public restrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their biological sex.
In an interview with the Washington Times, Ms. Zatopek said she was alarmed after discovering the Facebook post a few days ago while visiting her grandfather in Florida, and called the local police.
She said she plans to contact Houston law enforcement after she returns, but that the Harris County district attorney's office is already aware of the threat.
""I wanted to have proof of the day the threat was made,"" said Ms. Zatopek, who appeared in 2013 on the NBC reality show ""Ready for Love"" and now works as a Christian Broadcasting Network reporter.
The Facebook account has since been removed and The Times was unable to contact the purported owner for comment or for confirmation of his name.
Houston voters cast ballots Tuesday on Proposition 1, which has drawn national attention over its provision imposing fines of up to $5,000 on business owners who try to bar transgender people from using the public accommodations, including restrooms and showers, of their choice.
In her latest video, Ms. Zatopek says that ""supporters of Proposition 1 have said that something like this would never happen,"" referring to attacks on women in public restrooms by men claiming to be transgender.
The video then shows a clip of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major U.S. city and a strong supporter of Proposition 1, saying at a press conference such arguments are ""lies, they are misinformation ... this just doesn't happen.""
Ms. Zatopek then says in her video, ""I urge you to read that post again and decide for yourself.""
The pro-Proposition 1 campaign, Houston Unites, did not comment publicly on the threat, but proponents have previously decried the opposition's ""scare tactics,"" arguing that Houston has laws against harassment, public indecency and assault that will continue to apply to public restrooms and elsewhere.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,430,91.04,72.2,15.63,1.72,33.08,25.35,82.33,58.84,46.74,9.3,5.58,0.7,0,0.93,2.09,0.93,3.72,14.42,9.3,1.86,15.58,5.58,2.33,5.35,1.16,12.33,4.65,1.4,6.51,0.7,0.93,4.88,9.53,0.47,9.07,1.16,1.4,1.4,0.47,0.23,3.26,0,4.42,0.7,3.72,1.16,0.23,0.93,0.47,0.47,0,0,19.53,10.23,0,1.16,2.79,0.23,3.72,9.77,0.23,0,3.49,1.16,2.56,2.33,0.23,0,2.33,0,0.23,1.63,0.7,0.23,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,1.16,0.23,3.26,6.74,0.7,0.47,4.42,1.4,0,0,6.05,4.65,3.95,0.7,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,15.12,5.12,5.12,0,0,0.7,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,3.47,3.69,3.02,3.35,2.65,-3.94,-3.11,-1.79,-2.14,-2.7,0.23,0.7,0.23,2.09,1.16,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.23,0.23,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.32,0.82,14.09,116.01,0.23,371.23,-2.55,92.81,0.23,116.01,0.7,92.81,-0.93,255.22,1.16,510.44,0,46.4,0,23.2,0.23,0,0,46.4,116.01,116.01,23.2,46.4,23.2,-0.23,46.4,69.61,0,46.4,0,0,0,46.4,0,46.4,139.21,23.2,0,1.63,1,0,1.86,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,1

11/4/15,19,Opinion,Houston soundly rejects equal rights ordinance ,"HOUSTON (AP) &mdash; The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was soundly rejected Tuesday by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent. The defeat came after a nearly 18-month battle in the nation&rsquo;s fourth-largest city that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. In the months leading up to Tuesday&rsquo;s vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women&rsquo;s restrooms. The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000. Supporters said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories. Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay and championed the ordinance, led a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston in a chant that referenced the ordinance&rsquo;s nickname, HERO, yelling, &ldquo;A hero fights for justice.&rdquo; Still, the future of the ordinance looked uncertain. Parker is finishing her final two-year term, and it&rsquo;s unclear if the next mayor and city council will revisit the issue. Parker, a Democrat, and other supporters described the &ldquo;bathroom ordinance&rdquo; campaign as &ldquo;fear mongering.&rdquo; The state&rsquo;s top two elected leaders &mdash; Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans &mdash; praised the defeat, with Abbott saying voters &ldquo;showed values still matter.&rdquo; Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, described the ordinance as &ldquo;pandering to political correctness.&rdquo; He said it was only about allowing men to enter women&rsquo;s restrooms and locker rooms &ldquo;defying,&rdquo; in his words, &ldquo;common sense and common decency.&rdquo; Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday&rsquo;s defeat of the ordinance made Houston &ldquo;a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct
stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.&rdquo; The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot. Tuesday&rsquo;s referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston&rsquo;s religious community. Kristen Capps, a Houston attorney who supported the ordinance, remained optimistic after Tuesday&rsquo;s defeat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like every civil rights movement.

11/4/15,19,News,Houston voters reject LGBT nondiscrimination ,"HOUSTON - An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Supporters of the ordinance had said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents of the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance had called this ""bathroom ordinance strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ordinance also had received support from other members of Houston's religious community.

Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.
On Monday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott had tweeted his support for opponents, saying, ""HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not (at)HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.

11/4/15,19,News,"Does Texas Speaker Joe Straus hear thunder on the right? He asks lawmakers to study school choice, immigration, fetal tissue ","AUSTIN ‚Äî Speaker Joe Straus has instructed House colleagues to study ways to expand parents‚Äô choices of where they can send their children to school, how state and local laws on illegal immigrants mesh with federal immigration enforcement and how medical and research entities are handling fetal tissue.
If you‚Äôre Lt. Dan Patrick, you just say lawmakers are going to line up their ducks on ‚Äúschool choice,‚Äù ‚Äúsanctuary cities‚Äù and ‚Äúprotecting the unborn.‚Äù
Those are code words for busting up the education establishment, getting tough on immigration and discrediting Planned Parenthood.
But Straus is more understated. He also inhabits a political universe in which Democrats and moderate Republicans actually count for something.
When the San Antonio Republican on Wednesday released his ‚Äúinterim charges,‚Äù or directions for House members as they plan for the 2017 session, he did a lot of talking about things he‚Äôd really rather discuss: Texas‚Äô fast growing population, and the strains it puts on infrastructure, educational institutions‚Äô capacity, public health systems, disaster readiness and long-term fiscal policy, especially in light of changing energy markets.
Straus also, though, apparently felt compelled to ask for studies of things essential to tea party adherents and social conservatives. In his announcement, Straus made no reference to the larger, and increasingly conservative Texas political environment. Instead, he framed his study requests as member-driven.
‚ÄúI take my colleagues‚Äô input very seriously,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt was important that these charges reflect not only issues that matter to me, but also those that matter to House members.
Still, there‚Äôs probably no way to ignore the full-throated conservative cries of his fellow state leaders.
Last month, Gov. Greg Abbott accused Sheriff Lupe Valdez of effectively making Dallas County a ‚Äúsanctuary city‚Äù by saying she‚Äôd no longer hold immigrants in the county jail for federal officials for an additional 48 hours, once the person is past his or her release date if he or she is charged with minor offenses. On Wednesday, Abbott sent all Texas sheriffs a thinly veiled threat that he‚Äôll cut off their criminal justice grant money if they follow Valdez‚Äôs example.
A day earlier, Abbott and Patrick triumphed by helping defeat a Houston gay rights measure they called ‚Äúthe bathroom ordinance.‚Äù Patrick is promising more property tax reductions, and has promoted an anti-abortion group‚Äôs undercover videotapes and suggestions that Planned Parenthood makes money off the harvesting of fetal tissue during abortions.

HOUSTON ‚Äî The landslide defeat of a nondiscrimination ordinance in Houston has stunned LGBT-rights activists across the nation. They're now bracing for their opponents in other states to seize on the successful tactic of stoking fears over transgender people's access to public restrooms.
By a 61-to-39-percent margin, voters in America's fourth largest city on Tuesday rejected a broad equal-rights ordinance ‚Äî extending protections in employment, housing and public spaces on the basis of race, sexual orientation, gender identity and other categories. Opponents prevailed with a campaign that dubbed the measure ""the bathroom ordinance"" and raised the specter of male sexual predators invading women's restrooms.
The outcome was ""a devastating blow to equality,"" said the Human Rights Campaign, a national group advocating for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.
""It's almost unbelievable that this could happen in a city like Houston,"" said the campaign's president, Chad Griffin. ""But make no mistake: If we don't double down today, we'll face the same thing again and again in cities across the nation.""
The ordinance lost despite strong support from many major businesses, and despite its supporters' arguments that serious problems with bathroom access have been virtually nonexistent in the 17 states and scores of cities that have banned discrimination against transgender people in public accommodations.
""This is a national game-changer,"" said Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values Action, which opposed the ordinance. He described the result as ""a massive victory for common sense, safety and religious freedom.""
The outcome in Houston was swiftly seized upon by opposing sides in California, where the legislature passed a law in 2013 allowing transgender students to participate in activities and use facilities corresponding to their gender identity. Opponents are gathering signatures for a 2016 ballot measure that would overturn the law and require people to use facilities that correspond with their ""biological sex.""
Karen England of Privacy for All, which is promoting the ballot measure, noted that in both Houston and California there were efforts to prevent a public vote on the nondiscrimination issue.
""Houston elites were afraid to let the voters vote, and they had good reason to be,"" England said. ""We think California elites have similar reason to be afraid.""
England's group and its allies are seeking to collect 500,000 signatures by Nov. 20 to ensure they have enough valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
A coalition of gay-rights supporters who back California's 2013 law warned that the state may face a campaign echoing the one in Houston.
""We fully expect our opponents to use the same misinformation and scare tactics in California that they used in Houston,"" said Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California. ""Since they can no longer stop same-sex couples from getting married, this is the next page in their attempts to discriminate against the LGBT community.""
In Houston, there was some second-guessing on Wednesday as to whether supporters of the ordinance ‚Äî including the lesbian mayor, Annise Parker ‚Äî could have mounted a more effective campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, said the campaign failed to counteract the ""bathroom ordinance"" message with arguments that might have better resonated with voters, particularly African-Americans who turned out in large numbers.
Stein said voters might have supported the ordinance if persuaded that its defeat could mean potential economic losses, including companies deciding not to relocate to Houston or organizations deciding not to hold meetings or conventions in the city.
Ordinance supporters, including the Greater Houston Partnership, an influential business group, had warned that defeat of the measure might trigger economic boycotts or endanger plans for Houston to host the Super Bowl in 2017 or the NCAA Final Four in 2016. But the message that supporters pushed in advertising focused mainly on protections against discrimination.
""They had allies in the African-American community, who are traditionally Democratic and progressive voters but did not buy into the argument that gays and more specifically transgender (people) are a group that needs to be protected,"" Stein said.
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, described the result as ""sad for Houston.""
""I fear this will have stained Houston's reputation as a tolerant, welcoming, global city,"" she said. ""And I absolutely fear that there will be a direct, economic backlash as a result of this ordinance going into defeat.""
The NFL said the ordinance's defeat will not affect plans for the 2017 Super Bowl.
""We will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events,"" the NFL said. ""Our policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.""
Nationally, nondiscrimination laws have become the LGBT-rights movement's top priority now that same-sex marriage is legal in every state.
A proposed federal nondiscrimination law is given no chance of passage any time soon because of Republican opposition, so activists are waging local and state-level campaigns. Frequently, the most visceral issue that arises is transgender people's access to public restrooms, and in some cases public schools have become the battleground.
In Palatine, Illinois, for example, school officials are at odds with the U.S. Education Department after being told they're violating federal law by denying a transgender student unrestricted access to a girls' high school locker room. In Wisconsin, some Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would bar transgender students from using the locker room or bathroom assigned to the gender with which they identify.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,908,91.36,61.65,19.22,10.42,24.54,31.61,80.95,56.06,44.6,6.72,3.19,0.22,0.88,0,0.33,1.32,3.52,15.09,8.59,1.54,13.99,6.5,2.31,4.74,0.88,11.67,6.5,2.42,9.03,2.53,1.21,5.29,10.57,0.77,9.8,1.21,2.31,0.88,1.76,0.55,3.63,0,3.85,1.32,2.31,1.43,0.11,1.1,0.66,0.33,0.11,0,14.1,6.39,0.66,0.22,1.54,0.44,2.53,7.49,0.22,0,0.66,0.44,3.3,3.08,0.22,0,4.41,0.88,0.33,2.64,0.55,0.22,2.75,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,1.32,0.11,0,0.22,0,0.33,0,0.22,0,0.11,0.77,0.11,3.63,8.7,0.88,0.88,6.5,0.11,0.11,0.22,2.09,3.85,2.53,1.98,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,18.17,4.3,6.17,0,0,1.87,5.84,0,0.33,0,0.11,0.33,0,3.93,4.04,3.72,3.78,3.24,-3.36,-1.77,-0.57,-1.24,-1.75,0,0.88,0.11,0.11,0.99,0.44,1.43,0,0.22,0,0.44,0.44,0.99,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.62,1.62,16.25,99.12,0.55,253.3,-0.66,154.19,0.99,176.21,0.66,143.17,-1.21,264.32,0.33,286.34,0,88.11,-0.11,44.05,0.44,11.01,0,66.08,143.17,220.26,44.05,11.01,110.13,0.33,110.13,132.16,22.03,33.04,11.01,0.11,0,22.03,55.07,88.11,143.17,44.05,11.01,1.43,1,0.77,1.54,0.22,0,0,0,0.33,0,0.33,0.11,0.88,0.11,1

‚ÄúThis is a national game-changer,‚Äù said Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values Action, which opposed the ordinance. He described the result as ‚Äúa massive victory for common sense, safety and religious freedom.‚Äù
The outcome in Houston was swiftly seized upon by opposing sides in California, where the legislature passed a law in 2013 allowing transgender students to participate in activities and use facilities corresponding to their gender identity. Opponents are gathering signatures for a 2016 ballot measure that would overturn the law and require people to use facilities that correspond with their ‚Äúbiological sex.‚Äù
Karen England of Privacy for All, which is promoting the ballot measure, noted that in both Houston and California there were efforts to prevent a public vote on the nondiscrimination issue.
‚ÄúHouston elites were afraid to let the voters vote, and they had good reason to be,‚Äù England said. ‚ÄúWe think California elites have similar reason to be afraid.‚Äù
England‚Äôs group and its allies are seeking to collect 500,000 signatures by Nov. 20 to ensure they have enough valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
A coalition of gay-rights supporters who back California‚Äôs 2013 law warned that the state may face a campaign echoing the one in Houston.
‚ÄúWe fully expect our opponents to use the same misinformation and scare tactics in California that they used in Houston,‚Äù said Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California. ‚ÄúSince they can no longer stop same-sex couples from getting married, this is the next page in their attempts to discriminate against the LGBT community.‚Äù
In Houston, there was some second-guessing on Wednesday as to whether supporters of the ordinance ‚Äî including the lesbian mayor, Annise Parker ‚Äî could have mounted a more effective campaign. Robert Stein, a political scientist at Rice University, said the campaign failed to counteract the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù message with arguments that might have better resonated with voters, particularly African-Americans who turned out in large numbers.
Stein said voters might have supported the ordinance if persuaded that its defeat could mean potential economic losses, including companies deciding not to relocate to Houston or organizations deciding not to hold meetings or conventions in the city.
Ordinance supporters, including the Greater Houston Partnership, an influential business group, had warned that defeat of the measure might trigger economic boycotts or endanger plans for Houston to host the Super Bowl in 2017 or the NCAA Final Four in 2016. But the message that supporters pushed in advertising focused mainly on protections against discrimination.
‚ÄúThey had allies in the African-American community, who are traditionally Democratic and progressive voters but did not buy into the argument that gays and more specifically transgender (people) are a group that needs to be protected,‚Äù Stein said.
Parker, who is completing her third and final term, described the result as ‚Äúsad for Houston.‚Äù
‚ÄúI fear this will have stained Houston‚Äôs reputation as a tolerant, welcoming, global city,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd I absolutely fear that there will be a direct, economic backlash as a result of this ordinance going into defeat.‚Äù
The NFL said the ordinance‚Äôs defeat will not affect plans for the 2017 Super Bowl.
‚ÄúWe will work closely with the Houston Super Bowl Host Committee to make sure all fans feel welcomed at our events,‚Äù the NFL said. ‚ÄúOur policies emphasize tolerance and inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.‚Äù
Nationally, nondiscrimination laws have become the LGBT-rights movement‚Äôs top priority now that same-sex marriage is legal in every state.
A proposed federal nondiscrimination law is given no chance of passage any time soon because of Republican opposition, so activists are waging local and state-level campaigns. Frequently, the most visceral issue that arises is transgender people‚Äôs access to public restrooms, and in some cases public schools have become the battleground.
In Palatine, Ill., for example, school officials are at odds with the U.S. Education Department after being told they‚Äôre violating federal law by denying a transgender student unrestricted access to a girls‚Äô high school locker room. In Wisconsin, some Republican lawmakers have introduced a bill that would bar transgender students from using the locker room or bathroom assigned to the gender with which they identify.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,908,91.1,61.01,19.78,10.42,24.54,31.5,81.06,56.17,44.71,6.83,3.3,0.33,0.88,0,0.33,1.32,3.52,15.09,8.59,1.54,13.99,6.61,2.31,4.74,0.88,11.78,6.5,2.42,9.03,2.53,1.21,5.29,10.57,0.77,9.8,1.21,2.31,0.88,1.76,0.55,3.63,0,3.85,1.32,2.31,1.43,0.11,1.1,0.66,0.33,0.11,0,14.1,6.39,0.66,0.22,1.54,0.44,2.53,7.49,0.22,0,0.66,0.44,3.3,3.08,0.22,0,4.41,0.88,0.33,2.64,0.55,0.22,2.75,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,1.32,0.11,0,0.22,0,0.33,0,0.22,0,0.11,0.77,0.11,3.63,8.7,0.88,0.88,6.5,0.11,0.11,0.22,2.09,3.85,2.53,2.09,0.11,0,0.11,0,0,18.39,4.41,6.17,0,0,1.87,5.95,0,0.33,0,0.11,0.33,0,3.94,4.06,3.72,3.78,3.25,-3.42,-1.84,-0.64,-1.29,-1.8,0,0.88,0.11,0.11,0.99,0.44,1.43,0,0.22,0,0.44,0.44,0.99,0.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.63,1.69,16.28,99.12,0.55,253.3,-0.66,154.19,0.99,176.21,0.66,154.19,-1.32,264.32,0.33,286.34,0,88.11,-0.11,44.05,0.44,11.01,0,66.08,143.17,220.26,44.05,11.01,110.13,0.33,110.13,132.16,22.03,33.04,11.01,0.11,0,22.03,55.07,88.11,143.17,44.05,11.01,1.43,1,0.53,1.48,0.21,0,0,0,0.32,0,0.32,0.11,0.84,0.11,1
11/4/15,19,News,Ohio says ‚Äòno‚Äô to legalizing marijuana ,"
Ohio voters soundly rejected a marijuana initiative Tuesday that would have legalized recreational and medicinal use of the drug, and would have limited commercial growing to a small group of investors who drafted and promoted the measure.
The initiative was failing 65 percent to 35 percent, with more than three-quarters of precincts reporting.
‚ÄúIssue 3 has been soundly defeated!‚Äù Ohioans Against Marijuana Monopolies crowed on Twitter. ‚ÄúNo marijuana monopolies in this state!‚Äù
Four other states, including Washington, and the District of Columbia have already legalized the recreational sale of marijuana, which is still a federal crime. Ohio would have been the first state in the Midwest to do so.
But along with opposition from anti-drug groups and state elected officials, Ohio‚Äôs unorthodox initiative drew discomfort from some legalization supporters.
Opponents alleged that Issue 3 would have effectively set up a monopoly by limiting commercial marijuana growth to 10 preselected plots of land owned by the entrepreneurs behind the measure.
A group of 24 investors backing the measure included former NBA star Oscar Robertson, descendants of President William Howard Taft and former boy-band celebrity Nick Lachey.
The ‚ÄúResponsibleOhio‚Äù legalization campaign was driven by political consultant Ian James, who acknowledged he would profit from the measure.
State legislators seeking to derail Issue 3 had presented voters with an ‚Äúantimonopoly‚Äù initiative, Issue 2, designed to nullify the marijuana initiative and ban special-interest groups from creating constitutional amendments for financial gain. Generally, under Ohio law, whichever ballot measure receives more votes prevails.
The vote for the antimonopoly initiative was much closer. It was leading, 52 percent to 48 percent, with 76 percent of precincts reporting.
The defeat of the marijuana measure was the first such loss for a recreational legalization initiative since 2012, and the first loss for marijuana advocates more generally since Florida rejected medical marijuana last year, according to John Hudak, a fellow with the Brookings Institute.
In a statement after the vote, Tom Angell of the pro-legalization group the Marijuana Majority called Issue 3 a ‚Äúflawed measure‚Äù that ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt represent what voters wanted.
The measure would have imposed a 15 percent tax on gross revenues of growing operations and a 5 percent tax on gross revenues of retail marijuana stores, plus annual licensing fees.
Fifty-five percent of the taxes would have been distributed to cities and townships and 30 percent to counties for infrastructure and public safety purposes. The remaining 15 percent would have gone to the marijuana commission.
‚ÄòAirbnb proposition‚Äô behind in S.F. Proposition F, the contentious San Francisco ballot measure that would impose tighter restrictions on short-term housing rental services such as San Francisco-based Airbnb, was losing Tuesday night.
According to the city‚Äôs election website, the measure was behind, 58 percent to 42 percent, with about 91,000 ballots counted.
If passed, the measure would cap rentals to 75 days a year, whether or not they are hosted (meaning that the resident is at home during the renter‚Äôs stay). Current city law limits rentals to 90 days a year for unhosted rentals, while hosted rentals face no such limit.
Proposition F would also allow ‚Äúinterested parties‚Äù such as neighbors or landlords to sue short-term rental companies such as VRBO and Airbnb if they violate the new rules. Airbnb had raised more than $8 million to oppose the measure and put up a series of controversial billboards that touted the $12 million the company has generated in city hotel tax revenue.
The costly ballot fight became an emblem of the widening inequities that define today‚Äôs San Francisco, where the revved-up tech economy and dearth of housing have driven the median price of a one-bedroom apartment to $4,000 a month.
Opponents had criticized it as a clumsily crafted scapegoat for anxieties over a housing crisis with much broader causes than short- term rental housing.
The measure was one of a number on the ballot targeting the housing crisis.
Proposition I took aim at the Mission District, where displacement has been particularly pronounced. It would place a moratorium on market-rate housing development here for at least 18 months while a ‚Äúneighborhood stabilization plan‚Äù is crafted to ensure affordable housing is created. It, too, was losing in early returns.
Voters. however, appeared to be giving the thumbs up to Proposition A, a $310-million affordable housing bond heavily backed by Mayor Ed Lee, who has presided over the boom and ran virtually unopposed for a second term.
Houston rejected LGBT rights proposal
Houston voters rejected a controversial measure Tuesday that would have barred discrimination against gays and transgender people in the wake of an 18-month battle that pitted advocates of gay rights against those who believed they were defending religious liberty.
The vote had been expected to be close. But with about 30 percent of precincts reporting, the measure was trailing badly, 62 percent to 38 percent, and The Associated Press called the election for foes of the measure.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was initially approved by the City Council in May 2014. But opponents sued. In July, the Texas Supreme Court ordered the city to either repeal it or place the measure on the ballot.
Texas is one of 28 states that do not have statewide nondiscrimination protections ‚Äî although major cities have adopted policies, including Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio. Of the other 22 states, 17 bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, housing and public accommodations, and four offer limited protections.
Supporters, including Mayor Annise Parker, the first lesbian mayor of a major U.S. city; NAACP officials, pastors and business leaders, say the measure would offer increased protections for 15 groups, including gay and transgender people.
Political analysts have said the measure enjoyed early support. But conservative opponents reached out to minorities and eroded that support. Much hinged on turnout, which was expected to be high because of a heated race to replace Parker, who is stepping down because of term limits.
Conservative leaders also campaigned and spoke out against the ordinance, including a coalition of pastors, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and former Houston Astro Lance Berkman. Opponents say the measure, which they call Proposition 1 or the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance,‚Äù infringes on their religious beliefs and poses a public-health risk by allowing transgender women into women‚Äôs restrooms.
Parker and her supporters said Houston would lose tourism and convention business if the city had to repeal the ordinance and became known for intolerance, just as a backlash in Indiana over a religious-objections law led to convention cancellations there.",Bathroom Ordinance ,1,1088,95.27,42.76,9.35,8.3,20.53,33,79.23,52.76,42.28,3.31,1.19,0.09,0,0,0.18,0.46,2.11,13.79,9.47,4.5,13.97,6.25,1.93,5.97,0.46,10.11,4.69,5.97,6.53,0.64,1.75,4.23,8,0.18,7.63,0.55,1.19,1.47,0.92,0.09,3.22,0,3.31,1.01,2.3,0.37,0.09,0.28,0.09,0,0,0,8.18,3.4,0.28,0,1.29,0.09,0.74,4.23,0.09,0,0.37,0.09,3.22,3.03,0,0.18,7.81,0.46,1.38,2.76,3.4,0.46,2.48,0.28,0,0,0,1.1,0.55,0,0,0.37,0.09,0.28,0.37,0,0,0.18,1.29,0.28,2.85,6.43,0.28,0.64,4.96,0.18,0.28,0.28,3.03,5.15,1.19,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,15.07,4.96,5.42,0,0.18,0.64,3.86,0,0.09,0,0,0,0,3.5,3.52,3.17,3.6,2.8,-2.57,-1.54,-0.27,-1.96,-1.65,0.37,0.55,0.09,0.18,0.64,0.28,0.92,0,0.37,0,0.18,0.37,1.01,0.28,0.18,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.06,1.06,15.44,55.15,0.46,211.4,-0.55,64.34,0.55,137.87,0.83,137.87,-1.38,321.69,0.28,441.18,0,147.06,0.18,45.96,0.46,0,0,18.38,119.49,101.1,45.96,27.57,82.72,0,73.53,55.15,9.19,36.76,0,0,0,64.34,27.57,82.72,55.15,18.38,0,0.92,1,0.18,0.45,0,0,0,0,0.09,0,0.18,0.18,0.27,0.09,1
11/4/15,19,US News,"Houston rejects hotly contested anti-discrimination ordinance - Dubbed the ‚Äòbathroom ordinance‚Äô by opponents, wide-ranging measure aimed to improve legal rights for 15 classes including race, color, disability and religion ","
Equal rights activists were dealt a blow on Tuesday night as voters in Houston resoundingly rejected an anti-discrimination ordinance that was the subject of a fierce battle that garnered national attention.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, dubbed Hero, became one of the highest-profile LGBT rights clashes since the US supreme court ruled in favour of same-sex marriage in June. Activists sought greater legal protections against discrimination, especially in places such as Texas where there is no statewide law banning discrimination against LGBT people.
Houston‚Äôs wide-ranging ordinance was designed to build on federal law by improving legal rights for 15 classes, among them race, colour, disability, religion, age, military status, marital status and sexual orientation.
Related: 'Bathroom predator' spin on Houston equal rights bill puts Texans in hot seat
Opponents, many of them conservative Christians, zeroed in on a reference to gender identity and depicted the law as a ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù. They produced campaign advertisements which sought to stoke fears that the law was in effect a license for sexual predators in women‚Äôs clothing to enter restrooms and commit assaults. ‚ÄúAny man at any time could enter a women‚Äôs bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt, even registered sex offenders,‚Äù one warned.
Several hundred Hero supporters had crammed into a barbecue joint in downtown Houston for a post-election party but a serious setback dampened the mood soon after the polls closed. Results from early voting showed 63% voted to repeal the ordinance with 37% in favour of keeping it. The numbers showed little change when results from Tuesday began to trickle in and make a heavy loss look inevitable.
Two hours and 15 minutes after the polls closed the pro-Hero campaign took to the stage to concede defeat. ‚ÄúWe came up short,‚Äù said Richard Carlbom, the campaign manager for Houston Unites.
‚ÄúHero is about one thing and one thing only, fighting discrimination, giving Houstonians a local tool to solve a local problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been revolting to me personally to see how a handful of extremists have demonised transgender people in our community. It was an ugly, ugly smear campaign built around an outright lie. It does not reflect Houston values.‚Äù
Annise Parker, the Houston mayor who had passionately championed the ordinance, said she feared an economic backlash and blamed prejudice towards transgender people for the result. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt misinformation, this is a calculated campaign of lies designed to demonise a little-understood minority and to use that to take down an ordinance that 200 other cities across America and 17 states have successfully passed and operated under. They just kept spewing an ugly lot of lies on our TV screens and pulpits,‚Äù she said.
Parker said the outcome was down to a small group of ‚Äúrightwing ideologues‚Äù who ‚Äúknow only how to destroy, not to build up‚Äù.
The barbecue restaurant was a stone‚Äôs throw from Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros baseball team. One of the Astros‚Äô former stars, retired slugger Lance Berkman, returned to prominence in September when he appeared in an anti-Hero advertisement pushing the seemingly effective ‚Äúbathroom predators‚Äù line that equal rights activists decried as dishonest.
Sitting on a bench in the dining hall, Dolores Hernandez said she was ‚Äúnot too surprised because of the opponents‚Äô ad campaigns ‚Äì ‚Äúthose were very powerful ... but completely dishonest‚Äù. In a bid to boost support and perhaps even go viral, the 43-year-old had created a pro-Hero Twitter account with cat memes, which she flicked through on her smartphone as the campaign leaders prepared to take the stage to give the audience the news.
Hernandez said she was worried about Houston‚Äôs image in light of the ordinance‚Äôs repeal. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to look really bad in front of the entire country,‚Äù she said.
In the campaign, prominent pastors and politicians mobilised against the proposal. A group called Campaign for Houston, which led the opposition, described the ordinance as ‚Äúan attack on the traditional family‚Äù designed for ‚Äúgender-confused men who ... can call themselves ‚Äòwomen‚Äô on a whim‚Äù.
The Obama administration, Hillary Clinton and several celebrities weighed in to support the measure.
But stuck into the grass outside polling stations on Tuesday, amid the usual forests of brightly coloured posters with candidates‚Äô names, it was not hard to spot signs urging ‚Äúno men in women‚Äôs bathrooms‚Äù. However false, the label has been effective, David McAllister said as he sat in George, a sports bar in Montrose, the focal point of Houston‚Äôs gay community.
‚ÄúI was having coffee earlier this morning, listening to several gay men discussing it as the ‚Äòbathroom ordinance‚Äô, knowing nothing about it,‚Äù he said on Tuesday afternoon. ‚ÄúToo many younger people are not politically informed.‚Äù He worried that a vote to spurn the ordinance would give the impression that ‚Äúin the fourth-largest city in the country, discrimination ‚Äì maybe just stupidity ‚Äì exists‚Äù.
Advocates pointed out that similar ordinances exist in several hundred other American cities, including Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, and there is no evidence that transgender people have carried out sexual assaults as a result of the laws. In fact, they argue, transgender women are disproportionately likely to be the targets of attacks, while sexual assault is already illegal in any context.
The ordinance was backed by a wide range of the city‚Äôs business leaders, who warned that rejecting it would have a negative effect on the city‚Äôs image and economy. Under Mayor Annise Parker, Houston has tried hard to present itself as a cosmopolitan, welcoming and forward-thinking metropolis and it will attract international attention when it hosts the Super Bowl in 2017.
Equal rights and football collided last year when then-Arizona governor Jan Brewer came under pressure from the NFL and others to veto a so-called ‚Äúreligious freedom‚Äù bill ahead of last February‚Äôs Super Bowl in the Phoenix area.
Houston‚Äôs mayoral election also took place on Tuesday. Parker, a Democrat who became the first openly gay mayor of a major city in 2009, could not stand for re-election because of a three-term limit. Opponents accused her of backing the ordinance as part of a ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù after she said in 2014 that ‚Äúthe debate is about me‚Äù.
When the city council passed the ordinance last year, anti-Hero campaigners submitted a petition in an attempt to force a referendum on the issue. Following protracted legal wrangling, its enforcement was suspended in July when the Texas supreme court ordered the city to either repeal it or place it on the ballot.

11/4/15,19,US News,Transgender advocates lament backlash against failed Houston equal rights bill - Opponents of Hero Equal Rights Ordinance‚Äôs gender identity protections dealt first major setback to LGBT movement since same-sex marriage legalization ,"
In 2015, in America‚Äôs fourth-largest city and one of its most diverse, backing the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance might have seemed an obvious choice.
The ordinance passed May 2014 to protect against a broad range of discrimination had a noble nickname: Hero. It enjoyed the support of the White House, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, local and national civil rights groups, Hollywood celebrities, regional business groups and major companies including Apple.
The pro-Hero campaign made sensible appeals to voters, raising the potential negative impact on the city‚Äôs image and economy of repealing a bill that simply protected against discrimination for 15 broad categories, among them not just sexual orientation and gender identity, but also race, marital status, pregnancy, age, religion and military service.
The campaign had $3m in funds and a strong grassroots effort, from volunteers canvassing and putting up placards to one person starting a Twitter memes account called Houston Cats for Hero.
And then the ballots were counted. With the country watching, Houston voters overwhelmingly decided to reject Hero on Tuesday night, dealing LGBT rights campaigners their first big setback since marriage equality was won nationwide this past summer and underlining that resistance from the religious right remains strong in some parts of the US.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not surprising to see backlash,‚Äù said Jennifer Levi, director of the Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders‚Äô transgender rights project. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hugely disappointing, but it‚Äôs part of what happens when you have discussions about marginalised groups. This fight may have sharpened the opposition, but it expanded the range of support for transgender equality.‚Äù

The pro-Hero campaign relied on logic and reasonableness, which as a strategy turned out to be no match for a stark yet spurious slogan from opponents: ‚ÄúNo men in women‚Äôs bathrooms.‚Äù
This line, peddled endlessly and rooted in groundless suspicion of transgender people, sought to scare voters into believing that because of the reference to gender identity, a broad civil rights bill was in essence a license for sexual predators to attack women in bathrooms.
Nationwide, transgender rights advocates are scrutinising the loss for lessons to apply to future fights. The outcome exposes a persistent gap between the courts, where trans rights advocates have been increasingly successful in winning protections under existing laws and public opinion.
Mara Keisling, the founder and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said one takeaway from the Houston vote is that trans rights suffer in areas of the country where transgender individuals don‚Äôt have enough visibility.
‚ÄúThis was, clearly, a lack of underlying, fundamental public awareness and acceptance,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe know that once people know a trans person personally, or even just know a little bit more about us, it‚Äôs harder to bring up these old stereotypes and scare tactics that don‚Äôt have any basis in truth. But you can‚Äôt just say, ‚Äòthat‚Äôs not true‚Äô without being known to people and trusted.‚Äù
Keisling also criticized local media outlets that gave equal credence to supporters of the measure and those who raised bogus fears about predators. In combatting these stereotypes, she said, trans rights advocates face the same public relations task that once faced the gay rights movement.
‚ÄúFears about gay predators becoming teachers held back that movement for a long time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tried-and-true tactic of the right wing. They‚Äôre giving people a reason to say, ‚ÄòWell, somebody thinks there is a risk of predators in this situation, so reluctantly, I have to go along with them.‚Äô We need to really pay attention to, do people know us?‚Äù
The winning side, meanwhile, hope their success will inspire similar revolts in other US cities. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fed up with being threatened and intimidated. It‚Äôs time for people across the nation to stand up and say we‚Äôre not taking this anymore,‚Äù Steve Riggle, a pastor in Houston, told Fox News.
As Hero supporters consoled themselves with brisket and beer at a downtown barbecue joint on Tuesday, anti-ordinance activists celebrated at a post-election party in a swanky hotel eight miles away. The Texas lieutenant governor, Dan Patrick ‚Äì a Republican who is the state‚Äôs second most powerful politician ‚Äì took to the stage and reiterated the anti-campaign‚Äôs core message. ‚ÄúIt was about protecting our grandmoms and our mothers and our wives and our sisters and our granddaughters,‚Äù he said.
One commercial depicted a man following a schoolgirl into a toilet stall. The fearmongering clearly resonated with voters who strongly spurned what, on the face of it, should have been an unremarkable bill: 61% voted against it and 39% for, though only about 260,000 votes were cast in a city of 2.2 million inhabitants, making for a turnout of 27% among registered voters.
Despite the ordinance explicitly offering protections based on race, colour, national origin and ethnicity, a Houston Chronicle results map shows that some of the strongest resistance came not only from conservative, suburban, mainly white areas but from predominantly black and Hispanic neighbourhoods.
Yet as proponents pointed out, more than 200 cities have similar ordinances on the books, including Texas‚Äôs major urban areas. Dallas, similar in size, culture and demographics to Houston, updated its charter without fuss a year ago to clearly include non- discrimination protections for city employees based on sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. More than three-quarters of voters were in favour and the move built on a 20-year-old ordinance.
But there were special circumstances in Houston: a loud band of dissenters with a powerful spin, a sense among Christian conservatives that the traditional family is under attack, especially in the wake of the US supreme court legalising same-sex marriage in June, and a desire to give the mayor a black eye.
Annise Parker, who is leaving her post in January after winning the maximum three terms, is a Democrat who became the first openly gay mayor of a major US city in 2009. She made the ordinance a personal mission, attracting critics who said she was pursuing a ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù and outraged pastors ‚Äì and there are a lot of them in this Bible belt metropolis ‚Äì by trying to subpoena their sermons as part of protracted legal wrangles after the city council passed the ordinance last year.
Despite the reference to religious protection included in the ordinance, some of its opponents portrayed the vote as a battle for religious liberty, evoking memories of clashes over so-called ‚Äúreligious freedom‚Äù laws in Indiana and Arkansas last spring and in Arizona last year.
As politicians weighed in, an equality issue also took on a predictably partisan Republicans-versus-Democrats hue. Greg Abbott, the Republican Texas governor, took to Twitter to urge voters to ‚ÄúVote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values‚Äù.
Patrick said voters told ‚Äúthose who supported this, including Hillary Clinton, who wants to be the next president, that you‚Äôre out of touch with America, you‚Äôre out of touch with your own party, you‚Äôre out of touch with common sense, you‚Äôre out of touch with common decency. I‚Äôm glad Houston led tonight to end this constant political correctness attack on what we know in our heart and our gut is not right‚Äù.
DeAnne Cuellar, a spokeswoman for Equality Texas, a partner in the pro-Hero Houston Unites coalition, said the result is ‚Äúa huge defeat, especially coming after such a big win with marriage equality‚Äù, and said it owed much to opponents successfully framing it as a ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù ordinance. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is reflective of Houston. It‚Äôs a warm and welcoming city,‚Äù she said.
Cuellar, echoing Parker‚Äôs concession speech, said that activists will lick their wounds, analyse what went wrong and then make a renewed push for equal rights in a place where local laws matter because there are no statewide anti-bias protections for LGBT people. ‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs giving up,‚Äù she said.",Houston Unites,1,1296,90.44,68.45,32.79,17.54,26.45,28.55,83.41,58.56,45.14,8.02,4.01,0.23,1.23,0.54,0.69,0.69,4.01,14.27,8.49,1.93,15.2,4.94,3.4,5.48,1.16,11.03,6.79,3.63,8.33,2.55,1.08,4.86,9.57,0.31,9.1,1.93,1.47,0.77,0.93,0.46,3.47,0.08,5.63,2.62,2.85,1.39,0.39,0.85,0.39,0.23,0.08,0,14.66,6.56,0.62,0.15,1.31,1,2.08,7.95,0.69,0,1.39,0.23,3.86,3.63,0.23,0,3.01,0.39,0.15,1.39,0.54,0.69,2.24,0.23,0.08,0.08,0,0.08,0.93,0.23,0,0.23,0.23,0.39,0.46,0.08,0,0.62,1,0.08,3.86,10.57,0.62,1.39,7.18,0.85,0.15,0.62,2.93,4.4,3.09,0.85,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.83,3.78,7.33,0.08,0,2.55,5.09,0,0.46,0,0.39,0.08,0.15,3.75,3.95,3.53,3.86,3.11,-3.06,-1.1,0.02,-0.87,-1.43,0.31,0.54,0.15,0.62,2.16,0.23,0.77,0,0.69,0.08,1,0.23,1.16,0.46,0.31,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.08,0.15,2.64,1.72,19.25,177.47,0.85,331.79,0.54,216.05,2.01,162.04,1.23,115.74,-1,447.53,1.31,262.35,0,208.33,0.23,61.73,0.62,23.15,0,46.3,169.75,123.46,46.3,15.43,92.59,0,146.6,108.02,38.58,54.01,15.43,0,0,54.01,7.72,108.02,138.89,23.15,7.72,1.08,1,0.22,0.89,0.45,0.07,0,0,0.22,0,0.22,0.3,0.74,0,1
11/4/15,19,Public Policy,Houston Fails to Affirm Critical Non-Discrimination Ordinance ,"
HOUSTON, Nov. 4 -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas issued the following news release:
On Tuesday, Nov. 3, Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance, or Proposition 1, was voted down. The following may be attributed to Terri Burke, Executive Director of the ACLU of Texas:
""It's a tragedy that Houston remains the only major city in Texas--indeed, the last big city in the United States--that does not extend equal rights protections to all of its residents and visitors. This is not who we are and I hope when this issue arises again, the city's majority will vote and do the right thing. The next mayor and newly elected members of Houston's city council must prioritize the passage of a new equal rights ordinance as quickly as possible.
""Opponents of equality utilized fear-mongering and disinformation to sway Houston voters to deny equal rights and protections to people in this great city, but none of us who have worked to bring equality to Houston are throwing in the towel. We will continue the fight to ensure that everyone can live fairly and equally under the law.

11/4/15,19,National,Rape threat roils Houston ballot campaign on transgender bathroom access ,"
The campaign over a Houston ballot measure on transgender rights has been hit by an apparent rape threat against a former Miss Texas USA contestant who has campaigned against the proposal.
Angela Zatopek posted a video Sunday showing a screenshot from Facebook in which a man who supports the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance says in a message that he cannot wait for it to pass ""so I can dress up like a woman and follow you around and rape you in bathrooms.""
A Houston native, Ms. Zatopek became a public face of the campaign after appearing in an ad last month urging a ""no"" vote on Proposition 1, which would let people use public restrooms that correspond to their gender identity rather than their biological sex.
In an interview with the Washington Times, Ms. Zatopek said she was alarmed after discovering the Facebook post a few days ago while visiting her grandfather in Florida, and called the local police.
She said she plans to contact Houston law enforcement after she returns, but that the Harris County district attorney's office is already aware of the threat.
""I wanted to have proof of the day the threat was made,"" said Ms. Zatopek, who appeared in 2013 on the NBC reality show ""Ready for Love"" and now works as a Christian Broadcasting Network reporter.
The Facebook account has since been removed and The Times was unable to contact the purported owner for comment or for confirmation of his name.
Houston voters cast ballots Tuesday on Proposition 1, which has drawn national attention over its provision imposing fines of up to $5,000 on business owners who try to bar transgender people from using the public accommodations, including restrooms and showers, of their choice.
In her latest video, Ms. Zatopek says that ""supporters of Proposition 1 have said that something like this would never happen,"" referring to attacks on women in public restrooms by men claiming to be transgender.
The video then shows a clip of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, the first openly lesbian mayor of a major U.S. city and a strong supporter of Proposition 1, saying at a press conference such arguments are ""lies, they are misinformation ... this just doesn't happen.""
Ms. Zatopek then says in her video, ""I urge you to read that post again and decide for yourself.""
The pro-Proposition 1 campaign, Houston Unites, did not comment publicly on the threat, but proponents have previously decried the opposition's ""scare tactics,"" arguing that Houston has laws against harassment, public indecency and assault that will continue to apply to public restrooms and elsewhere.",Houston Unites,1,430,91.04,72.2,15.63,1.72,33.08,25.35,82.33,58.84,46.74,9.3,5.58,0.7,0,0.93,2.09,0.93,3.72,14.42,9.3,1.86,15.58,5.58,2.33,5.35,1.16,12.33,4.65,1.4,6.51,0.7,0.93,4.88,9.53,0.47,9.07,1.16,1.4,1.4,0.47,0.23,3.26,0,4.42,0.7,3.72,1.16,0.23,0.93,0.47,0.47,0,0,19.53,10.23,0,1.16,2.79,0.23,3.72,9.77,0.23,0,3.49,1.16,2.56,2.33,0.23,0,2.33,0,0.23,1.63,0.7,0.23,1.86,0,0,0,0,0,0.93,0,0,0,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,1.16,0.23,3.26,6.74,0.7,0.47,4.42,1.4,0,0,6.05,4.65,3.95,0.7,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,15.12,5.12,5.12,0,0,0.7,4.19,0,0,0,0,0,0.23,3.47,3.69,3.02,3.35,2.65,-3.94,-3.11,-1.79,-2.14,-2.7,0.23,0.7,0.23,2.09,1.16,0,0.23,0,0.23,0,0.23,0.23,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.32,0.82,14.09,116.01,0.23,371.23,-2.55,92.81,0.23,116.01,0.7,92.81,-0.93,255.22,1.16,510.44,0,46.4,0,23.2,0.23,0,0,46.4,116.01,116.01,23.2,46.4,23.2,-0.23,46.4,69.61,0,46.4,0,0,0,46.4,0,46.4,139.21,23.2,0,1.63,1,0,1.86,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,1
11/4/15,19,Domestic News,Houston LGBT nondiscrimination ordinance rejected by voters ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
With nearly 95 percent of precincts reporting, Houston residents had rejected the ordinance by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent.
Supporters of the ordinance said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, blamed the rejection by voters on opponents' ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign, which she called ""fear mongering"" and part of an effort to demonize the LGBT community.
""This was a calculated campaign by a small, very determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religious right, and they only know how to destroy and not how to build up,"" Parker told a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston.
Maria Gonzalez, an English instructor at the University of Houston, who supported the ordinance and was at the watch party, said she was disappointed by the measure's defeat.
""The wedge issue has always been gay people. The outsiders come in and say they don't want gay and trans people protected,"" she said.
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying the voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance ""liberal nonsense"" that voters were right to see as never about equality, saying that was ""already the law."" Rather, he said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms ""defying"" ‚Äî in his words ‚Äî ""common sense and common decency.""
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston ""a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.""
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines  up to $5,000.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.",Campaign for Houston ,1,622,94.6,58.25,9.12,16.56,23.92,31.99,83.12,56.27,43.25,5.31,2.41,0,0,0,0.8,1.13,2.89,13.02,9.16,1.45,14.95,4.82,3.05,5.79,0.48,11.09,5.79,3.54,8.2,1.61,0.8,5.95,9.16,0.48,8.52,1.29,1.61,1.29,0.96,0,3.7,0,4.02,1.77,2.09,0.8,0,0.64,0.16,0,0.32,0,15.11,7.56,0.96,0.32,1.93,0.64,2.73,7.23,0.16,0,1.13,0.64,4.98,4.98,0,0,4.98,0.64,0.96,1.93,0.32,1.29,3.22,0.32,0,0.16,0,0,1.93,0.32,0,0,0.16,0.32,0,0,0.16,0.16,1.13,0.16,3.54,6.27,0.64,0.64,4.34,0.96,0,0.32,2.89,5.63,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,16.88,4.18,6.75,0,0,1.61,4.34,0,0,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,4,4.11,3.84,4.11,3.4,-3.92,-1.89,-1.02,-1.6,-1.79,0.64,0.48,0,0.32,0.96,0.32,1.45,0.16,1.13,0,1.29,0.32,0.96,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,2.86,1.5,15.25,128.62,1.29,209,0.8,160.77,1.29,112.54,0.48,144.69,-1.13,321.54,0,273.31,0,289.39,0.8,128.62,1.29,16.08,0,16.08,128.62,160.77,48.23,16.08,64.31,0.16,80.39,96.46,32.15,32.15,0,0,0,112.54,32.15,32.15,192.93,0,0,0.96,1,0.48,1.75,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.96,0.8,0,1
11/4/15,19,Domestic,Houston equal rights measure in hands of voters ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston is in the hands of voters after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
Houston residents were voting Tuesday on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which supporters say would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but would also provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
""I voted yes because I believe (in) opportunity for all individuals and I believe that the people that vote no are going to be on the wrong side of history,"" Anna Bakken said Tuesday outside a polling site.
Opponents of the ordinance planned to reach out to voters Tuesday at polling locations and through social media, phones calls and emails, said Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston.
Those against the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, have said it infringes on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents have focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents allege would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""I don't know why anyone would think that men going into a women's bathroom or swimming pool or locker room would be a good idea,"" Susan Hunter, who voted against the ordinance, said Tuesday. ""It's not safe and these people need to find another solution.""
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance have called this ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum has drawn attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ordinance also has received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Woodfill said opponents of the ordinance have included a diverse group of individuals, including pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.
On Monday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted his support for opponents, saying, ""HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.""

The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was soundly rejected Tuesday by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent, following a nearly 18- month battle in the nation's fourth-largest city that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
But Parker, who is gay and championed the ordinance, led a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston in a chant that referenced the ordinance's nickname, HERO, yelling, ""A hero fights for justice.""
""I guarantee that justice in Houston will prevail. This ordinance, you have not seen the last of. We're united. We will prevail,"" Parker said.
Still, the future of the ordinance looked uncertain. Parker is finishing her final two-year term, and it's unclear if the next mayor and city council will revisit the issue.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Supporters said it would have offered increased protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and would have protected against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would allow sexual predators to use women's restrooms.
Parker, a Democrat, and other supporters described the ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign as ""fear mongering.""
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, described the ordinance as ""pandering to political correctness."" He said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms ""defying,"" in his words, ""common sense and common decency.""
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston ""a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.""
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Kristen Capps, a Houston attorney who supported the ordinance, remained optimistic.

11/4/15,19,Domestic Elections,GOP wins Kentucky governor's race in top state election ,"
Kentucky voters have elected just the second Republican in four decades to hold the governor's office, in a race that hinged largely on President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.
The result represented a big win for the GOP as it continues to consolidate political power across the South. Democrats also came up short in Virginia, where they made a costly push to win a majority in one chamber of the state Legislature.
The governor's race in Kentucky was the highest profile contest in Tuesday's off-year elections. The only other gubernatorial campaign was in Mississippi, where Republican Gov. Phil Bryant easily won re-election.
Elsewhere, Houston voters defeated a closely watched ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the city, and Ohio voters rejected an initiative that sought to legalize the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana.
In Kentucky, Republican businessman Matt Bevin had waged a campaign to scale back the state's Medicaid expansion that was made possible under the federal health care overhaul. Some 400,000 lower-income people who gained health coverage under the expansion could be affected.
Bevin ran as an outsider, emphasizing his Christian faith along with his support for Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. His Democratic opponent, two-term Attorney General Jack Conway, embraced Obama's health care reforms, saying hundreds of thousands of residents could lose access to taxpayer-funded insurance if Bevin won.
""The degree to which the national party is out of step with mainstream Kentuckians has created an environment where it's extraordinarily difficult for a Democrat to win statewide,"" said state Auditor Adam Edelen, who lost his re-election bid to a little-known Republican state representative.
Around the country, several high-profile ballot initiatives tested voter preferences on school funding, marijuana, gay and lesbian rights and the sharing economy. Despite the relatively low number of races, the results could be an important bellwether of sentiment ahead of next year's presidential elections.
In Virginia, a swing state, Democrats failed in an expensive bid to take control of the state Senate and empower Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in negotiations with Republicans who control the state House. With the losses in Virginia and Kentucky, it was a rough Election Day for Democrats.
""I don't think you can point to one singular issue as to why these defeats happened tonight, but it's an opportunity for Democrats to recalibrate and continue to develop a plan and a strategy to win in 2016,"" said Tharon Johnson, who led Obama's 2012 re-election effort in the South and helps oversee finances for the Democratic National Committee.
The governor's race in Mississippi was overshadowed by a fight over a constitutional amendment that would allow people to sue the state to increase funding for public schools. Voters defeated the proposed amendment.
Critics say it would have taken budget decisions away from Mississippi lawmakers and given the courts too much power.
In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, efforts to secure non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people failed by a 2-to-1 margin. Now that same-sex marriage is legal, such laws have become a priority for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups. Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said the measure would have infringed on their religious beliefs. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott praised the voters who defeated the measure, saying they ""showed values still matter.""
In the race for Houston's next mayor, veteran state Rep. Sylvester Turner and Bill King, a former mayor of a Houston suburb, will meet in a Dec. 12 runoff. It was one of more than 300 mayoral races happening across the country. In Philadelphia, former longtime Councilman Jim Kenney was elected mayor on a promise to fight poverty and push for universal pre-kindergarten education.
In Salt Lake City, former state lawmaker Jackie Biskupski had a narrow lead in her challenge to two-term incumbent Mayor Ralph Becker. But thousands of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling places Tuesday remain to be counted. If elected, Biskupski would be the city's first openly gay mayor.
State judicial elections in recent years have become a focal point for political parties and interest groups seeking to influence the courts. Tuesday's election to fill three open seats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was the latest judicial contest to attract heavy attention and spending.
Campaign contributors poured at least $11.5 million into the race, which saw Democrats win all the seats.
San Francisco voters rejected a citizen-backed initiative to restrict the operations of Airbnb, the room-rental site, but approved a $310 million bond package for affordable housing in the city.
In Washington state, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to add state penalties for anyone who imports certain animal products for commercial purposes, such as elephant ivory or rhino horns
And Colorado voters decided to let the state keep $66 million in tax revenue generated from the sale of recreational marijuana. An existing state law requires excess tax revenue to be returned to taxpayers, but on Tuesday voters agreed to make an exception with the marijuana revenue and direct it instead toward public education and drug-prevention programs.",Campaign for Houston ,1,855,97.95,53.33,13.98,35.11,21.38,32.4,78.83,53.45,40.47,3.98,1.87,0.12,0,0.12,0.58,0.35,2.11,14.04,9.71,2.69,14.97,4.44,1.87,3.86,0.12,10.64,5.5,5.26,9.36,0.94,2.69,5.73,7.6,0.35,7.13,0.7,1.87,1.17,0.7,0.12,2.22,0,4.44,2.69,1.64,0.23,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,8.89,3.86,0.94,0,0.58,0,0.94,4.56,0.23,0,0.35,0.58,7.37,7.25,0.12,0,6.2,0.47,0.35,2.46,2.57,0.47,2.57,0.7,0,0,0,0.47,0.94,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.35,0.12,0.23,0,1.05,0.7,0.12,3.04,9.47,0.58,0.94,7.6,0.35,0,0.23,2.34,5.03,1.29,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,15.44,4.8,5.26,0,0,1.87,3.51,0,0.58,0,0.12,0,0,3.8,3.99,3.51,3.79,2.94,-2.67,-1.02,0.2,-0.53,-1.27,0.23,0.23,0.94,0.23,0.35,0,0.58,0.12,0.47,0.12,0.58,0,0.23,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.28,1.61,19.97,140.35,0.94,198.83,0.23,198.83,1.17,163.74,1.64,128.65,-0.58,491.23,1.64,409.36,0,292.4,0.58,35.09,0.35,11.7,0,11.7,327.49,327.49,46.78,11.7,81.87,0,81.87,81.87,58.48,0,11.7,0.12,0,58.48,11.7,93.57,116.96,0,0,0.35,1,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,0.35,0,1

HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
With nearly 95 percent of precincts reporting, Houston residents had rejected the ordinance by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent.

Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, blamed the rejection by voters on opponents' ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign, which she called ""fear mongering"" and part of an effort to demonize the LGBT community.
""This was a calculated campaign by a small, very determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religious right, and they only know how to destroy and not how to build up,"" Parker told a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston.
Maria Gonzalez, an English instructor at the University of Houston, who supported the ordinance and was at the watch party, said she was disappointed by the measure's defeat.
""The wedge issue has always been gay people. The outsiders come in and say they don't want gay and trans people protected,"" she said.
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying the voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance ""liberal nonsense"" that voters were right to see as never about equality, saying that was ""already the law.""

Houston residents were voting Tuesday on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which supporters say would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but would also provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
""I voted yes because I believe (in) opportunity for all individuals and I believe that the people that vote no are going to be on the wrong side of history,"" Anna Bakken said Tuesday outside a polling site.
Opponents of the ordinance planned to reach out to voters Tuesday at polling locations and through social media, phones calls and emails, said Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston.
Those against the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, have said it infringes on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents have focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents allege would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""I don't know why anyone would think that men going into a women's bathroom or swimming pool or locker room would be a good idea,"" Susan Hunter, who voted against the ordinance, said Tuesday. ""It's not safe and these people need to find another solution.""
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance have called this ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.

HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston failed to win approval from voters on Tuesday.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was rejected after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
With nearly 95 percent of precincts reporting, Houston residents had rejected the ordinance by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent.
Supporters of the ordinance said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, blamed the rejection by voters on opponents' ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign, which she called ""fear mongering"" and part of an effort to demonize the LGBT community.
""This was a calculated campaign by a small, very determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religious right, and they only know how to destroy and not how to build up,"" Parker told a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston.
Maria Gonzalez, an English instructor at the University of Houston, who supported the ordinance and was at the watch party, said she was disappointed by the measure's defeat.
""The wedge issue has always been gay people. The outsiders come in and say they don't want gay and trans people protected,"" she said.
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying the voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance ""liberal nonsense"" that voters were right to see as never about equality, saying that was ""already the law."" Rather, he said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms ""defying"" ‚Äî in his words ‚Äî ""common sense and common decency.""
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston ""a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.""
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.",Campaign for Houston ,1,622,94.6,58.25,9.12,16.56,23.92,31.99,83.12,56.27,43.25,5.31,2.41,0,0,0,0.8,1.13,2.89,13.02,9.16,1.45,14.95,4.82,3.05,5.79,0.48,11.09,5.79,3.54,8.2,1.61,0.8,5.95,9.16,0.48,8.52,1.29,1.61,1.29,0.96,0,3.7,0,4.02,1.77,2.09,0.8,0,0.64,0.16,0,0.32,0,15.11,7.56,0.96,0.32,1.93,0.64,2.73,7.23,0.16,0,1.13,0.64,4.98,4.98,0,0,4.98,0.64,0.96,1.93,0.32,1.29,3.22,0.32,0,0.16,0,0,1.93,0.32,0,0,0.16,0.32,0,0,0.16,0.16,1.13,0.16,3.54,6.27,0.64,0.64,4.34,0.96,0,0.32,2.89,5.63,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,16.88,4.18,6.75,0,0,1.61,4.34,0,0,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,4,4.11,3.84,4.11,3.4,-3.92,-1.89,-1.02,-1.6,-1.79,0.64,0.48,0,0.32,0.96,0.32,1.45,0.16,1.13,0,1.29,0.32,0.96,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,2.86,1.5,15.25,128.62,1.29,209,0.8,160.77,1.29,112.54,0.48,144.69,-1.13,321.54,0,273.31,0,289.39,0.8,128.62,1.29,16.08,0,16.08,128.62,160.77,48.23,16.08,64.31,0.16,80.39,96.46,32.15,32.15,0,0,0,112.54,32.15,32.15,192.93,0,0,0.96,1,0.48,1.75,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.16,0.96,0.8,0,1
11/4/15,19,"Elections, Domestic, News",Mayor: Fight not over for Houston nondiscrimination measure ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî Houston Mayor Annise Parker has rallied supporters of a defeated ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the city, telling them the fight isn't over.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was soundly rejected Tuesday by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent, following a nearly 18- month battle in the nation's fourth-largest city that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
But Parker, who is gay and championed the ordinance, led a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston in a chant that referenced the ordinance's nickname, HERO, yelling, ""A hero fights for justice.""
""I guarantee that justice in Houston will prevail. This ordinance, you have not seen the last of. We're united. We will prevail,"" Parker said.
Still, the future of the ordinance looked uncertain. Parker is finishing her final two-year term, and it's unclear if the next mayor and city council will revisit the issue.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Supporters said it would have offered increased protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and would have protected against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would allow sexual predators to use women's restrooms.
Parker, a Democrat, and other supporters described the ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign as ""fear mongering.""
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying voters ""showed values still matter.""

11/4/15,19,Domestic Elections,GOP wins Kentucky governor's race in top state election ,"
Kentucky voters have elected just the second Republican in four decades to hold the governor's office, in a race that hinged largely on President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.
The result represented a big win for the GOP as it continues to consolidate political power across the South. Democrats also came up short in Virginia, where they made a costly push to win a majority in one chamber of the state Legislature.
The governor's race in Kentucky was the highest profile contest in Tuesday's off-year elections. The only other gubernatorial campaign was in Mississippi, where Republican Gov. Phil Bryant easily won re-election.
Elsewhere, Houston voters defeated a closely watched ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the city, and Ohio voters rejected an initiative that sought to legalize the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana.
In Kentucky, Republican businessman Matt Bevin had waged a campaign to scale back the state's Medicaid expansion that was made possible under the federal health care overhaul. Some 400,000 lower-income people who gained health coverage under the expansion could be affected.
Bevin ran as an outsider, emphasizing his Christian faith along with his support for Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. His Democratic opponent, two-term Attorney General Jack Conway, embraced Obama's health care reforms, saying hundreds of thousands of residents could lose access to taxpayer-funded insurance if Bevin won.
""The degree to which the national party is out of step with mainstream Kentuckians has created an environment where it's extraordinarily difficult for a Democrat to win statewide,"" said state Auditor Adam Edelen, who lost his re-election bid to a little-known Republican state representative.
Around the country, several high-profile ballot initiatives tested voter preferences on school funding, marijuana, gay and lesbian rights and the sharing economy. Despite the relatively low number of races, the results could be an important bellwether of sentiment ahead of next year's presidential elections.
In Virginia, a swing state, Democrats failed in an expensive bid to take control of the state Senate and empower Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in negotiations with Republicans who control the state House. With the losses in Virginia and Kentucky, it was a rough Election Day for Democrats.
""I don't think you can point to one singular issue as to why these defeats happened tonight, but it's an opportunity for Democrats to recalibrate and continue to develop a plan and a strategy to win in 2016,"" said Tharon Johnson, who led Obama's 2012 re-election effort in the South and helps oversee finances for the Democratic National Committee.
The governor's race in Mississippi was overshadowed by a fight over a constitutional amendment that would allow people to sue the state to increase funding for public schools. Voters defeated the proposed amendment.
Critics say it would have taken budget decisions away from Mississippi lawmakers and given the courts too much power.
In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, efforts to secure non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people failed by a 2-to-1 margin. Now that same-sex marriage is legal, such laws have become a priority for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups. Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said the measure would have infringed on their religious beliefs. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott praised the voters who defeated the measure, saying they ""showed values still matter.""
In the race for Houston's next mayor, veteran state Rep. Sylvester Turner and Bill King, a former mayor of a Houston suburb, will meet in a Dec. 12 runoff. It was one of more than 300 mayoral races happening across the country. In Philadelphia, former longtime Councilman Jim Kenney was elected mayor on a promise to fight poverty and push for universal pre-kindergarten education.
In Salt Lake City, former state lawmaker Jackie Biskupski had a narrow lead in her challenge to two-term incumbent Mayor Ralph Becker. But thousands of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling places Tuesday remain to be counted. If elected, Biskupski would be the city's first openly gay mayor.
State judicial elections in recent years have become a focal point for political parties and interest groups seeking to influence the courts. Tuesday's election to fill three open seats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was the latest judicial contest to attract heavy attention and spending.
Campaign contributors poured at least $11.5 million into the race, which saw Democrats win all the seats.
San Francisco voters rejected a citizen-backed initiative to restrict the operations of Airbnb, the room-rental site, but approved a $310 million bond package for affordable housing in the city.
In Washington state, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to add state penalties for anyone who imports certain animal products for commercial purposes, such as elephant ivory or rhino horns
And Colorado voters decided to let the state keep $66 million in tax revenue generated from the sale of recreational marijuana. An existing state law requires excess tax revenue to be returned to taxpayers, but on Tuesday voters agreed to make an exception with the marijuana revenue and direct it instead toward public education and drug-prevention programs.",Campaign for Houston ,1,855,97.95,53.33,13.98,35.11,21.38,32.4,78.83,53.45,40.47,3.98,1.87,0.12,0,0.12,0.58,0.35,2.11,14.04,9.71,2.69,14.97,4.44,1.87,3.86,0.12,10.64,5.5,5.26,9.36,0.94,2.69,5.73,7.6,0.35,7.13,0.7,1.87,1.17,0.7,0.12,2.22,0,4.44,2.69,1.64,0.23,0,0.12,0.12,0,0,0,8.89,3.86,0.94,0,0.58,0,0.94,4.56,0.23,0,0.35,0.58,7.37,7.25,0.12,0,6.2,0.47,0.35,2.46,2.57,0.47,2.57,0.7,0,0,0,0.47,0.94,0.12,0,0.12,0,0.35,0.12,0.23,0,1.05,0.7,0.12,3.04,9.47,0.58,0.94,7.6,0.35,0,0.23,2.34,5.03,1.29,0.47,0,0,0,0,0,15.44,4.8,5.26,0,0,1.87,3.51,0,0.58,0,0.12,0,0,3.8,3.99,3.51,3.79,2.94,-2.67,-1.02,0.2,-0.53,-1.27,0.23,0.23,0.94,0.23,0.35,0,0.58,0.12,0.47,0.12,0.58,0,0.23,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.28,1.61,19.97,140.35,0.94,198.83,0.23,198.83,1.17,163.74,1.64,128.65,-0.58,491.23,1.64,409.36,0,292.4,0.58,35.09,0.35,11.7,0,11.7,327.49,327.49,46.78,11.7,81.87,0,81.87,81.87,58.48,0,11.7,0.12,0,58.48,11.7,93.57,116.96,0,0,0.35,1,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.58,0.35,0,1

11/4/15,19,Domestic,Houston equal rights measure in hands of voters ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston is in the hands of voters after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
Houston residents were voting Tuesday on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which supporters say would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but would also provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
""I voted yes because I believe (in) opportunity for all individuals and I believe that the people that vote no are going to be on the wrong side of history,"" Anna Bakken said Tuesday outside a polling site.
Opponents of the ordinance planned to reach out to voters Tuesday at polling locations and through social media, phones calls and emails, said Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston.
Those against the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, have said it infringes on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents have focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents allege would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""I don't know why anyone would think that men going into a women's bathroom or swimming pool or locker room would be a good idea,"" Susan Hunter, who voted against the ordinance, said Tuesday. ""It's not safe and these people need to find another solution.""
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance have called this ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum has drawn attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ordinance also has received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Woodfill said opponents of the ordinance have included a diverse group of individuals, including pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.
On Monday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted his support for opponents, saying, ""HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.""

11/4/15,19,"Elections, Domestic, News",Mayor: Fight not over for Houston nondiscrimination measure ,"HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî Houston Mayor Annise Parker has rallied supporters of a defeated ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the city, telling them the fight isn't over.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was soundly rejected Tuesday by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent, following a nearly 18- month battle in the nation's fourth-largest city that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
But Parker, who is gay and championed the ordinance, led a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston in a chant that referenced the ordinance's nickname, HERO, yelling, ""A hero fights for justice.""
""I guarantee that justice in Houston will prevail. This ordinance, you have not seen the last of. We're united. We will prevail,"" Parker said.
Still, the future of the ordinance looked uncertain. Parker is finishing her final two-year term, and it's unclear if the next mayor and city council will revisit the issue.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Supporters said it would have offered increased protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and would have protected against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would allow sexual predators to use women's restrooms.
Parker, a Democrat, and other supporters described the ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign as ""fear mongering.""
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, described the ordinance as ""pandering to political correctness."" He said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms ""defying,"" in his words, ""common sense and common decency.""
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston ""a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.""
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Kristen Capps, a Houston attorney who supported the ordinance, remained optimistic.

11/4/15,19,Domestic,GOP wins Kentucky governor's race in top state election ,"Kentucky voters have elected just the second Republican in four decades to hold the governor's office, in a race that hinged largely on President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act.
The result represented a big win for the GOP as it continues to consolidate political power across the South. Democrats also came up short in Virginia, where they made a costly push to win a majority in one chamber of the state Legislature.
The governor's race in Kentucky was the highest profile contest in Tuesday's off-year elections. The only other gubernatorial campaign was in Mississippi, where Republican Gov. Phil Bryant easily won re-election.
Elsewhere, Houston voters defeated a closely watched ordinance that would have established nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in the city, and Ohio voters rejected an initiative that sought to legalize the recreational and medicinal use of marijuana.
In Kentucky, Republican businessman Matt Bevin had waged a campaign to scale back the state's Medicaid expansion that was made possible under the federal health care overhaul. Some 400,000 lower-income people who gained health coverage under the expansion could be affected.
Bevin ran as an outsider, emphasizing his Christian faith along with his support for Kim Davis, the Rowan County clerk jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. His Democratic opponent, two-term Attorney General Jack Conway, embraced Obama's health care reforms, saying hundreds of thousands of residents could lose access to taxpayer-funded insurance if Bevin won.
""The degree to which the national party is out of step with mainstream Kentuckians has created an environment where it's extraordinarily difficult for a Democrat to win statewide,"" said state Auditor Adam Edelen, who lost his re-election bid to a little-known Republican state representative.
Around the country, several high-profile ballot initiatives tested voter preferences on school funding, marijuana, gay and lesbian rights and the sharing economy. Despite the relatively low number of races, the results could be an important bellwether of sentiment ahead of next year's presidential elections.
In Virginia, a swing state, Democrats failed in an expensive bid to take control of the state Senate and empower Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe in negotiations with Republicans who control the state House. With the losses in Virginia and Kentucky, it was a rough Election Day for Democrats.
""I don't think you can point to one singular issue as to why these defeats happened tonight, but it's an opportunity for Democrats to recalibrate and continue to develop a plan and a strategy to win in 2016,"" said Tharon Johnson, who led Obama's 2012 re-election effort in the South and helps oversee finances for the Democratic National Committee.
The governor's race in Mississippi was overshadowed by a fight over a constitutional amendment that would allow people to sue the state to increase funding for public schools. Voters defeated the proposed amendment.
Critics say it would have taken budget decisions away from Mississippi lawmakers and given the courts too much power.
In Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city, efforts to secure non-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people failed by a 2-to-1 margin. Now that same-sex marriage is legal, such laws have become a priority for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender groups. Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said the measure would have infringed on their religious beliefs. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott praised the voters who defeated the measure, saying they ""showed values still matter.""
In the race for Houston's next mayor, veteran state Rep. Sylvester Turner and Bill King, a former mayor of a Houston suburb, will meet in a Dec. 12 runoff. It was one of more than 300 mayoral races happening across the country. In Philadelphia, former longtime Councilman Jim Kenney was elected mayor on a promise to fight poverty and push for universal pre-kindergarten education.
In Salt Lake City, former state lawmaker Jackie Biskupski had a narrow lead in her challenge to two-term incumbent Mayor Ralph Becker. But thousands of mail-in ballots that were dropped off at polling places Tuesday remain to be counted. If elected, Biskupski would be the city's first openly gay mayor.
State judicial elections in recent years have become a focal point for political parties and interest groups seeking to influence the courts. Tuesday's election to fill three open seats on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was the latest judicial contest to attract heavy attention and spending.
Campaign contributors poured at least $11.5 million into the race, which saw Democrats win all the seats.
San Francisco voters rejected a citizen-backed initiative to restrict the operations of Airbnb, the room-rental site, but approved a $310 million bond package for affordable housing in the city.
In Washington state, voters overwhelmingly approved a measure to add state penalties for anyone who imports certain animal products for commercial purposes, such as elephant ivory or rhino horns
And Colorado voters decided to let the state keep $66 million in tax revenue generated from the sale of recreational marijuana.

11/4/15,19,US News,"Houston rejects hotly contested anti-discrimination ordinance - Dubbed the ‚Äòbathroom ordinance‚Äô by opponents, wide-ranging measure aimed to improve legal rights for 15 classes including race, color, disability and religion","Equal rights activists were dealt a blow on Tuesday night as voters in Houston resoundingly rejected an anti-discrimination ordinance that was the subject of a fierce battle that garnered national attention.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, dubbed Hero, became one of the highest-profile LGBT rights clashes since the US supreme court ruled in favour of same-sex marriage in June. Activists sought greater legal protections against discrimination, especially in places such as Texas where there is no statewide law banning discrimination against LGBT people.
Houston‚Äôs wide-ranging ordinance was designed to build on federal law by improving legal rights for 15 classes, among them race, colour, disability, religion, age, military status, marital status and sexual orientation.
Related: 'Bathroom predator' spin on Houston equal rights bill puts Texans in hot seat
Opponents, many of them conservative Christians, zeroed in on a reference to gender identity and depicted the law as a ‚Äúbathroom ordinance‚Äù. They produced campaign advertisements which sought to stoke fears that the law was in effect a license for sexual predators in women‚Äôs clothing to enter restrooms and commit assaults. ‚ÄúAny man at any time could enter a women‚Äôs bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day. No one is exempt, even registered sex offenders,‚Äù one warned.
Several hundred Hero supporters had crammed into a barbecue joint in downtown Houston for a post-election party but a serious setback dampened the mood soon after the polls closed. Results from early voting showed 63% voted to repeal the ordinance with 37% in favour of keeping it. The numbers showed little change when results from Tuesday began to trickle in and make a heavy loss look inevitable.
Two hours and 15 minutes after the polls closed the pro-Hero campaign took to the stage to concede defeat. ‚ÄúWe came up short,‚Äù said Richard Carlbom, the campaign manager for Houston Unites.
‚ÄúHero is about one thing and one thing only, fighting discrimination, giving Houstonians a local tool to solve a local problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been revolting to me personally to see how a handful of extremists have demonised transgender people in our community. It was an ugly, ugly smear campaign built around an outright lie. It does not reflect Houston values.‚Äù
Annise Parker, the Houston mayor who had passionately championed the ordinance, said she feared an economic backlash and blamed prejudice towards transgender people for the result. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt misinformation, this is a calculated campaign of lies designed to demonise a little-understood minority and to use that to take down an ordinance that 200 other cities across America and 17 states have successfully passed and operated under. They just kept spewing an ugly lot of lies on our TV screens and pulpits,‚Äù she said.
Parker said the outcome was down to a small group of ‚Äúrightwing ideologues‚Äù who ‚Äúknow only how to destroy, not to build up‚Äù.
The barbecue restaurant was a stone‚Äôs throw from Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros baseball team. One of the Astros‚Äô former stars, retired slugger Lance Berkman, returned to prominence in September when he appeared in an anti-Hero advertisement pushing the seemingly effective ‚Äúbathroom predators‚Äù line that equal rights activists decried as dishonest.
Sitting on a bench in the dining hall, Dolores Hernandez said she was ‚Äúnot too surprised because of the opponents‚Äô ad campaigns ‚Äì ‚Äúthose were very powerful ... but completely dishonest‚Äù. In a bid to boost support and perhaps even go viral, the 43-year-old had created a pro-Hero Twitter account with cat memes, which she flicked through on her smartphone as the campaign leaders prepared to take the stage to give the audience the news.
Hernandez said she was worried about Houston‚Äôs image in light of the ordinance‚Äôs repeal. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to look really bad in front of the entire country,‚Äù she said.
In the campaign, prominent pastors and politicians mobilised against the proposal. A group called Campaign for Houston, which led the opposition, described the ordinance as ‚Äúan attack on the traditional family‚Äù designed for ‚Äúgender-confused men who ... can call themselves ‚Äòwomen‚Äô on a whim‚Äù.
The Obama administration, Hillary Clinton and several celebrities weighed in to support the measure.
But stuck into the grass outside polling stations on Tuesday, amid the usual forests of brightly coloured posters with candidates‚Äô names, it was not hard to spot signs urging ‚Äúno men in women‚Äôs bathrooms‚Äù. However false, the label has been effective, David McAllister said as he sat in George, a sports bar in Montrose, the focal point of Houston‚Äôs gay community.
‚ÄúI was having coffee earlier this morning, listening to several gay men discussing it as the ‚Äòbathroom ordinance‚Äô, knowing nothing about it,‚Äù he said on Tuesday afternoon. ‚ÄúToo many younger people are not politically informed.‚Äù He worried that a vote to spurn the ordinance would give the impression that ‚Äúin the fourth-largest city in the country, discrimination ‚Äì maybe just stupidity ‚Äì exists‚Äù.
Advocates pointed out that similar ordinances exist in several hundred other American cities, including Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, and there is no evidence that transgender people have carried out sexual assaults as a result of the laws. In fact, they argue, transgender women are disproportionately likely to be the targets of attacks, while sexual assault is already illegal in any context.
The ordinance was backed by a wide range of the city‚Äôs business leaders, who warned that rejecting it would have a negative effect on the city‚Äôs image and economy. Under Mayor Annise Parker, Houston has tried hard to present itself as a cosmopolitan, welcoming and forward-thinking metropolis and it will attract international attention when it hosts the Super Bowl in 2017.
Equal rights and football collided last year when then-Arizona governor Jan Brewer came under pressure from the NFL and others to veto a so-called ‚Äúreligious freedom‚Äù bill ahead of last February‚Äôs Super Bowl in the Phoenix area.
Houston‚Äôs mayoral election also took place on Tuesday. Parker, a Democrat who became the first openly gay mayor of a major city in 2009, could not stand for re-election because of a three-term limit. Opponents accused her of backing the ordinance as part of a ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù after she said in 2014 that ‚Äúthe debate is about me‚Äù.
When the city council passed the ordinance last year, anti-Hero campaigners submitted a petition in an attempt to force a referendum on the issue. Following protracted legal wrangling, its enforcement was suspended in July when the Texas supreme court ordered the city to either repeal it or place it on the ballot.

11/4/15,19,The Wire,Houston Equal Rights Ordinance With a LGBT Focus Is Walloped ,"An ordinance to ban discrimination against gay and transgender people in Houston was resoundingly rejected by voters on Tuesday.
With nearly 95 percent of precincts reporting, Houston residents had rejected the ordinance by a vote of 61 percent to 39 percent, reported The Associated Press.
Rejection of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance followed a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community.
Supporters of the ordinance said it would have offered increased protections for gay and transgender people, as well as protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
Opponents, including a coalition of conservative pastors, said it infringed on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents alleged would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, blamed the rejection by voters on opponents' ""bathroom ordinance"" campaign, which she called ""fear mongering"" and part of an effort to demonize the LGBT community.
""This was a calculated campaign by a small, very determined group of right-wing ideologues and the religious right, and they only know how to destroy and not how to build up,"" Parker told a crowd of more than 100 people at an election night watch party in downtown Houston.
Maria Gonzalez, an English instructor at the University of Houston, who supported the ordinance and was at the watch party, said she was disappointed by the measure's defeat.
""The wedge issue has always been gay people. The outsiders come in and say they don't want gay and trans people protected,"" she said.
The state's top two elected leaders ‚Äî Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, both Republicans ‚Äî praised the defeat, with Abbott saying the voters ""showed values still matter.""
Patrick, who vaulted to power on the basis of an ardent tea party following, called the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance ""liberal nonsense"" that voters were right to see as never about equality, saying that was ""already the law."" Rather, he said it was only about allowing men to enter women's restrooms and locker rooms ""defying"" ‚Äî in his words ‚Äî ""common sense and common decency.""
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a conservative political advocacy group, said in a statement that Tuesday's defeat of the ordinance made Houston ""a rallying cry for Americans tired of seeing their freedoms trampled in a politically correct stampede to redefine marriage and sexuality.""
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014, but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
The ordinance would have applied to businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants and hotels, private employers, housing, city employment and city contracting. It would have allowed residents to file a complaint if they felt they had been discriminated against based on the various protected categories. Religious institutions would have been exempt. Violators would have faced fines up to $5,000.
Tuesday's referendum drew attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. It also received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Campaign for Houston, which fought the ordinance, said opponents included a diverse group of individuals, such as pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.",Campaign for Houston ,1,620,95.25,57.37,9.73,13.34,23.85,32.42,83.06,56.29,43.06,5.16,2.42,0,0,0,0.81,1.13,2.74,13.06,9.35,1.45,15,4.52,3.06,5.65,0.48,10.97,5.81,3.55,8.06,1.61,0.48,6.13,9.19,0.48,8.55,1.29,1.61,1.13,0.97,0,3.87,0,4.03,1.61,2.26,0.81,0,0.65,0.16,0,0.32,0,15.48,7.9,0.97,0.32,2.26,0.65,2.74,7.26,0.16,0,1.13,0.65,5,5,0,0,5.16,0.65,0.97,2.1,0.32,1.29,3.23,0.32,0,0.16,0,0,1.94,0.32,0,0,0.16,0.32,0,0,0.16,0,0.97,0.16,3.39,6.29,0.65,0.65,4.35,0.97,0,0.32,2.74,5.81,0.48,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,16.77,4.19,6.94,0,0,1.61,4.03,0,0,0.16,0.16,0.16,0,4.07,4.17,3.9,4.13,3.5,-4.48,-2.33,-1.53,-1.93,-2.03,0.65,0.48,0,0.32,0.97,0.48,1.45,0.16,1.13,0,1.29,0.32,0.97,0,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.16,0,0,0,2.61,1.5,15.24,129.03,1.29,241.94,0.48,161.29,1.29,112.9,0.48,129.03,-0.97,306.45,-0.16,274.19,0,274.19,0.65,129.03,1.29,16.13,0,16.13,129.03,145.16,48.39,16.13,64.52,0.16,80.65,96.77,32.26,32.26,0,0,0,112.9,32.26,32.26,193.55,0,0,0.97,1,0.64,1.6,0.16,0,0,0,0.16,0,0.32,0.96,0.8,0,1

11/3/15,19,NA,Gay rights advocates watch Houston vote ,"Gay rights advocates in Michigan and across the country will be watching today's election results from Houston, where a local nondiscrimination proposal has become a proxy war between the national movement and its critics.
""This is the biggest example yet of what happens when we put our rights up for a vote like this,"" said Stephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance seeks to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, along with a host of other criteria, including race, religion, sex and military status.
It's the most prominent gay rights vote of its kind since a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marriage, and the campaign in the country's fourth largest city has been combative.
Critics have dubbed the proposal the ""bathroom ordinance,"" focusing on protections it would extend to transgender residents. A controversial attack ad suggested that ""any man, any time"" -- including a registered sex offender -- could enter a women's restroom if the proposal passes, and the commercial ended with an ominous image of a young girl walking into a bathroom stall.
""I think it's despicable,"" said Amy Hunter, Trans Advocacy Coordinator for the ACLU of Michigan. ""It preys on people's worst fears, and none of them are well founded.""
Hunter noted that 17 states and more than 200 municipalities -- including dozens in Michigan -- have similar anti-discrimination protections in place.
""And there has been no uptick in sexual assaults in women's restrooms,"" she said. ""It's an easy way to demonize people and distract from the fact that these kind of measures are really about protecting people.""
While LGBT groups say the attack ads are misleading, they also acknowledge the messaging has been effective.
The Houston proposal polled well initially, but support has dropped despite higher spending by supporters. Many now consider it a toss up.
""It's sobering, to say at least,"" said White.
The opposition group, which argues that its standing up for ""women's privacy,"" has also aired ads featuring former Houston Astros baseball player Lance Berkman, who is urging local voters to reject the measure.
Meanwhile, national LGBT groups like the Human Rights Campaign have dispatched employees to the city to fight for passage. The White House has offered verbal support, as have Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,393,88.44,64.13,20.03,4.42,21.83,29.26,83.97,58.02,45.29,7.38,1.78,0.25,0.51,0,0.25,0.51,5.6,15.01,9.16,1.02,13.49,7.12,3.31,5.09,0.51,12.72,7.12,3.05,7.89,1.02,0.51,6.36,7.89,0.51,7.12,0.51,1.53,0.76,1.53,0.25,2.8,0,5.09,1.53,3.56,1.02,0,1.02,0.51,0.51,0,0,17.05,9.41,0.76,0,2.54,1.02,2.8,7.12,0.25,0,1.27,0.51,3.82,3.82,0,0,3.05,0.25,0.51,1.53,0.51,0.25,2.29,0,0,0,0,0,2.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,4.07,9.92,1.02,1.53,6.36,1.27,0,0,3.05,3.05,5.09,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,21.12,5.09,6.36,0,0,2.54,7.12,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,3.53,3.9,3.47,3.74,3.17,-4.48,-1.63,-1.09,-1.25,-2.8,0,1.27,0,1.02,1.78,0.51,1.53,0,0.76,0,0.51,0.51,1.78,0.25,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,2.71,1.52,17.66,203.56,1.78,432.57,-1.27,101.78,1.02,127.23,1.27,178.12,-0.76,279.9,1.02,305.34,0,76.34,0.25,25.45,0.25,0,0,50.89,152.67,101.78,50.89,0,50.89,0.25,76.34,127.23,101.78,0,0,0,0,76.34,0,50.89,152.67,50.89,0,1.53,1,0.76,1.02,0.25,0,0,0,0.51,0,0.25,0.51,0.51,0,1
11/3/15,19,Trail Blazers,"Abbott, Clinton, celebrities join Twitter fight over Houston gay rights ordinance","
AUSTIN ‚ÄìTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton clashed on Twitter over whether Houston voters on Tuesday should reject or uphold a city ordinance that bans discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodations that is based on, among other things, sexual orientation and gender identity.
The so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, has attracted national attention and a dollar-fueled TV ad blitz.
HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.
- Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 2, 2015
Social conservatives such as Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Family Research Council president Tony Perkins call it the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance.‚Äù They say transgender people could cause problems ‚Äî especially if someone born a man who has a sex change uses the women‚Äôs restroom.
But it‚Äôs about more than potty security, Perkins blogged. He called it a ‚Äúradical measure, which punishes people who refuse to celebrate transgenderism and homosexuality with massive fines.‚Äù Perkins called the ordinance part of a ‚Äúnationwide march to silence religious liberty in America.‚Äù
Clinton, her opponent Bernie Sanders and Houston Mayor Annise Parker have endorsed retention of HERO, which has been the subject of a protracted legal and political battle. They say it simply would bring long-overdue, equal treatment to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. Supporters have deplored opponents‚Äô many TV commercials about bathrooms as attempts to scare Houstonians and exploit many people‚Äôs lack of familiarity with transgender people and their struggles.

Weighing in against the ordinance was former Houston Astro and Texas Ranger slugger Lance Berkman. Once known as ‚ÄúThe Big Puma,‚Äù he said he‚Äôs now speaking as the concerned father of four daughters. Berkman taped a TV ad urging rejection of the ordinance, and social conservative activist Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values tweeted about it:

Big corporations with a presence in Houston, such as Apple, Hewlett Packard, General Electric and Dow Chemical have urged support for the ordinance. They warn that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote would take down protections for racial and religious minorities as well as for LGBT residents. Also, Houston would be the nation‚Äôs largest city without an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting all of those subcategories of the population.
In a statement, Apple said voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù would send ‚Äúa clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity.‚Äù
As my colleague Bobby Blanchard noted here Monday, participation in early voting in Harris County topped all other urban counties. Experts said as many as 250,000 Houston residents might cast ballots in an election that includes not just the culture war battle but a hotly contested mayor‚Äôs race. In Houston‚Äôs last open-seat mayor‚Äôs race six years ago, only about 178,000 people voted.
Political scientists don‚Äôt know whether the choice of starkly different mayoral candidates ‚Äî different in race and ideology ‚Äî or the hubbub about gay rights and bathrooms drove the bigger turnout in Houston.

11/3/15,19,na,Gay rights advocates watch Houston vote ,"Gay rights advocates in Michigan and across the country will be watching today's election results from Houston, where a local nondiscrimination proposal has become a proxy war between the national movement and its critics.
""This is the biggest example yet of what happens when we put our rights up for a vote like this,"" said Stephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance seeks to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, along with a host of other criteria, including race, religion, sex and military status.
It's the most prominent gay rights vote of its kind since a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marriage, and the campaign in the country's fourth largest city has been combative.
Critics have dubbed the proposal the ""bathroom ordinance,"" focusing on protections it would extend to transgender residents. A controversial attack ad suggested that ""any man, any time"" -- including a registered sex offender -- could enter a women's restroom if the proposal passes, and the commercial ended with an ominous image of a young girl walking into a bathroom stall.
""I think it's despicable,"" said Amy Hunter, Trans Advocacy Coordinator for the ACLU of Michigan. ""It preys on people's worst fears, and none of them are well founded.""
Hunter noted that 17 states and more than 200 municipalities -- including dozens in Michigan -- have similar anti-discrimination protections in place.
""And there has been no uptick in sexual assaults in women's restrooms,"" she said. ""It's an easy way to demonize people and distract from the fact that these kind of measures are really about protecting people.""
While LGBT groups say the attack ads are misleading, they also acknowledge the messaging has been effective.
The Houston proposal polled well initially, but support has dropped despite higher spending by supporters. Many now consider it a toss up.
""It's sobering, to say at least,"" said White.
The opposition group, which argues that its standing up for ""women's privacy,"" has also aired ads featuring former Houston Astros baseball player Lance Berkman, who is urging local voters to reject the measure.
Meanwhile, national LGBT groups like the Human Rights Campaign have dispatched employees to the city to fight for passage. The White House has offered verbal support, as have Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and Bernie Sanders.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,393,88.44,64.13,20.03,4.42,21.83,29.26,83.97,58.02,45.29,7.38,1.78,0.25,0.51,0,0.25,0.51,5.6,15.01,9.16,1.02,13.49,7.12,3.31,5.09,0.51,12.72,7.12,3.05,7.89,1.02,0.51,6.36,7.89,0.51,7.12,0.51,1.53,0.76,1.53,0.25,2.8,0,5.09,1.53,3.56,1.02,0,1.02,0.51,0.51,0,0,17.05,9.41,0.76,0,2.54,1.02,2.8,7.12,0.25,0,1.27,0.51,3.82,3.82,0,0,3.05,0.25,0.51,1.53,0.51,0.25,2.29,0,0,0,0,0,2.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.76,0,4.07,9.92,1.02,1.53,6.36,1.27,0,0,3.05,3.05,5.09,1.27,0,0,0,0,0,21.12,5.09,6.36,0,0,2.54,7.12,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,3.53,3.9,3.47,3.74,3.17,-4.48,-1.63,-1.09,-1.25,-2.8,0,1.27,0,1.02,1.78,0.51,1.53,0,0.76,0,0.51,0.51,1.78,0.25,0.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.51,0,0,2.71,1.52,17.66,203.56,1.78,432.57,-1.27,101.78,1.02,127.23,1.27,178.12,-0.76,279.9,1.02,305.34,0,76.34,0.25,25.45,0.25,0,0,50.89,152.67,101.78,50.89,0,50.89,0.25,76.34,127.23,101.78,0,0,0,0,76.34,0,50.89,152.67,50.89,0,1.53,1,0.76,1.02,0.25,0,0,0,0.51,0,0.25,0.51,0.51,0,1
11/3/15,19,election,Houston equal rights ordinance getting trounced in early returns ,"
With early voting results in, Houston‚Äôs proposed ordinance to establish protections from discrimination for gay and transgender residents and several other classes was behind in the polls by a significant margin.
As the polls closed on Tuesday, early voting figures showed 63 percent of more than 130,000 Houston voters who cast ballots early voted against the measure. The embattled ordinance, better known as HERO, would make it illegal to discriminate against someone based on 15 different ‚Äúprotected characteristics,‚Äù including sex, race, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity.
Ordinance supporters say it‚Äôs intended to protect all Houstonians from discrimination and align Houston with other major cities that have similar measures. But opponents have zeroed in on the gender identity protection, which they argue would allow sexual predators to go into women‚Äôs bathrooms.
With the Houston vote garnering national attention, a loss for HERO supporters would come after a tumultuous year and half since the ordinance was first passed by the Houston City Council in May 2014.
Almost immediately, conservative activists and pastors began collecting signatures to petition a referendum or repeal of the ordinance. City officials later ruled that they hadn‚Äôt collected enough signatures, prompting a lawsuit from the opponents.
The ordinance had been in effect for about three months when it was put on hold as the legal challenge made its way through the courts. In April, a state district judge ruled in favor of the city, saying opponents of the ordinance had not gathered enough valid signatures.
The case went to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July told the city council it had to consider a valid referendum petition and repeal the ordinance or put it up for public vote.
As early voting began two weeks ago, Republican state leaders, including Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, lent their political muscle to the campaign opposing the ordinance. More recently, the Obama administration and national figures including Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders voiced support for the measure.
Statewide implications
But as the first big LGBT fight since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in June, the Houston vote could prove to be a referendum on the Texas gay rights movement, which has pivoted to discrimination protections since the Supreme Court win.
Texas is one of 28 states without statewide laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Democrats‚Äô inability to pass a statewide nondiscrimination measure out of the Republican-controlled Legislature has left the state with a patchwork of protections across the state.
Including the Houston council‚Äôs 2014 vote on HERO, nine Texas cities with a population of more than 100,000 have passed nondiscrimination rules or legislation.
For at least a decade, Fort Worth, Dallas and Austin have counted among cities with ordinances offering LGBT residents some degree of protection against discrimination in employment, housing and other public areas like buses and restaurants. San Antonio and Plano joined that list in 2014.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,490,97.86,30.95,42.95,28.4,22.27,30.61,79.18,55.71,42.65,3.47,0.82,0,0,0,0,0.61,2.65,13.88,8.98,2.86,17.14,4.29,1.22,6.53,0.41,10.41,7.55,5.1,7.35,0.82,0.82,5.71,9.8,0.2,9.18,1.22,2.65,0.82,1.02,0.2,4.29,0,3.06,1.84,1.22,0.2,0,0.2,0,0.2,0,0,8.16,4.69,0.41,0,1.84,0.82,0.82,3.06,0.2,0,0.2,0,6.94,6.94,0,0,2.45,0.2,0.61,1.02,0.2,0.41,2.24,0,0,0,0,0,1.63,0.2,0,0.41,0,0.61,0,0.41,0,0.2,1.84,0,2.86,7.55,0.2,2.04,5.51,0.2,0,0,4.9,4.69,0.82,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,12.45,4.9,5.51,0,0,1.22,0.82,0,0,0,0.2,0,0,3.73,4.32,3.57,4.05,3.27,-3.68,-1.6,-0.42,-1.43,-2.41,0.41,0.61,0,0.2,0.41,1.22,0,0,1.22,0.41,0.41,0.61,0.41,0.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.04,1.26,15.88,122.45,1.22,408.16,-0.82,163.27,0.82,122.45,1.02,122.45,-0.82,265.31,1.63,244.9,0,102.04,0.2,20.41,0.2,20.41,0,20.41,224.49,102.04,20.41,0,122.45,-0.2,61.22,204.08,20.41,0,0,0,0,81.63,20.41,81.63,61.22,0,0,0.41,1,1.01,1.41,0,0,0,0,0.6,0,1.01,0.4,0.2,0,1
11/3/15,19,election,What to watch for around the country on Election Day 2015 ‚Äî VIDEO ,"Even as Americans remain transfixed by Donald Trump and the feisty presidential contest that won't actually be decided for another 12 months, Election Day this year arrived Tuesday with plenty at stake.
Voters across the country are heading to the polls to make their picks in local elections, a couple of governors' races, and on dozens of important ‚Äî and sometimes quirky ‚Äî ballot measures in the off-year election.
In Kentucky, the closely fought battle for governor in one of 2015's most-watched contests pits wealthy tea party favorite Matt Bevin, who unsuccessfully took on Sen. Mitch McConnell, against Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway for the open seat. (McConnell is now backing Bevin.)
In Mississippi, incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant looks set to win another term, although the contest has been pushed to the background by a clash over a constitutional amendment that would allow voters to sue the state to boost funding for public schools. In Virginia, Democrats are seeking to capture the state Senate, which Republicans now hold narrowly. And there are notable elections for mayor in Philadelphia, Houston and Salt Lake City.
Meanwhile, heated debate surrounding an effort to defeat a LGBT rights law in Texas could become hot fodder for the presidential candidates, a billionaire is backing a major effort to protect Big Game, and voters in Seattle are weighing a unique answer to the problem of money in politics.
Here are some of the issues being decided Tuesday and that are sure to be dissected in the aftermath as pols, pundits and the press look for clues to what the results all mean in the 2016 contest for the White House:
Houston: LGBT rights on the line down south
""No Men In Women's Bathrooms"" ‚Äî that's the rallying cry from opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a law passed by the city last year to protect lesbian, gay and transgender people.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Clinton campaign joined the fray, responding to a baiting tweet from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, that urged Houston to ""vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values.""
Abbott, the Clinton campaign shot back, is ""right about one thing: equality is one of Hillary's values.""
In recent months, the campaign to undo HERO has become a focal point for the right, which has spent millions and recruited an assortment of local celebrities to their cause, including former Houston Astros star outfielder Lance Berkman.
""My wife and I have four daughters,"" Berkman says in an ad paid for by the Campaign for Houston PAC, which is seeking to repeal HERO. ""Proposition One would allow troubled men to enter women's public bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Supporters of the ordinance have bristled at the claim, calling it fear-mongering against transgender men and women.
Ohio: An ex-boy band star tunes up for legalizing pot
Nick Lachey, the onetime lead singer of 98 Degrees, is headlining again --- but the attraction is a little different this time around.
Lachey and a group of investors are behind ResponsibleOhio, a group that is pushing an initiative to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the Buckeye State. The amendment would permit anyone 21 and older to hold up to an ounce of pot for personal use. With a $50 license, they can house eight ounces of harvested pot and four plants. If passed, Ohio would become the most populous state to legalize pot.
""Ohio is my home,"" Lachey says over some breezy tunes in ad produced by the pro-legalization group, ""and I care very deeply about the people here."" He promises jobs, a ""reinvigorated economy"" and a safer state.
Also on the pot front, Colorado voters are deciding what they want to do with the millions in revenue raised from its sale -- return the funds to taxpayers or use it to pay for school construction and other things.
Seattle: Trying to make elections more ""honest""
How would you like a coupon to spend on your favorite candidate?
That's what's on the table in Seattle with the ""Honest Elections"" referendum to diminish the influence of money in politics.
Backers of ""Initiative 122"" are seeking to radically remake how local campaigns are financed. Under the measure, voters would each be given $100 in ""democracy vouchers"" --- four each, at $25 per --- to be shelled out to the candidates of their choice.
It would also lower donation caps, ban contributions from corporations with significant city business interests, increase transparency and increase fines for electoral wrongdoing. Officials who leave office would also be required spend three years on the sidelines before becoming eligible to register as lobbyists.
Washington: A push to save endangered animals
This one's for Cecil the Lion, the big Zimbabwean cat killed in July by a dentist on safari from Minnesota.
This statewide ballot measure would criminalize ""selling, purchasing, trading, or distributing certain animal species threatened with extinction,"" raising the bar beyond where laws already on the books in New York, New Jersey and California have previously gone to protect Big Game.
The measure is the brainchild of billionaire Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder, who has sunk millions of dollars of his own money into the campaign.
Opponents, including the ""Legal Ivory Rights Coalition,"" say the proposal goes too far. ""It's Not What They Say It Is!"" blares the group's website, which warns that grandmas looking to pass along their ""antique"" ivory will be made into criminals.
Not complaining: Elephants and rhinoceroses -- often hunted for the ivory in their tusks and horns -- along with lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, marine turtles, and sharks that are among the threatened species that supporters say would be helped by the referendum.
Texas: The NRA is on the hunt
On the other hand, Texans with a taste for ""hunting, fishing and harvesting"" could get a constitutional boost on Tuesday, as the state goes to the polls to weigh in on its Proposition 6.
The amendment would make it more difficult for activist groups to push through new legislation or regulations aimed at expanding protections for animals or delicate ecosystems. The NRA is leading the way in lobbying for its passage with groups like the ""Dallas Safari Club"" also boosting the cause.
If the measure passes, Texas would become the 19th state to guarantee its residents a constitutional right to hunt and kill almost all manner of wildlife and the freedom catch and ""bag"" as many fish as they can haul back home.
San Francisco: Airbnb could get the bootWill Airbnb be kicked out of its hometown?
The vanguard of the so-called ""sharing economy"" is locking horns with the left again, as affordable housing activists in increasingly unaffordable San Francisco are angling to deal a blow to Airbnb.
This measure would impose a citywide ban on what's known as ""short-term rentals."" If approved, it would effectively cripple Airbnb, the profitable hub for homeowners and renters who profit from leasing out rooms or houses to travelers for, in most cases, below market rates.
The problem: Rent and home sale prices in San Francisco are skyrocketing, along with evictions, and critics say the fault lies, at least in part, with wealthy buyers who purchase housing for the express purpose of leasing it out for a quick profit.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1197,97.05,51.01,16.25,30.46,24.94,25.4,78.53,57.14,45.78,5.35,1.84,0.33,0,0.17,0.17,0.75,3.51,14.54,9.44,2.17,17.38,5.93,2.26,4.51,0.42,12.11,4.26,4.18,5.85,1,0.92,4.09,8.44,0.25,8.19,0.84,1.75,1.84,1,0.25,2.42,0,2.92,1.84,1.09,0.17,0,0.17,0.08,0,0.08,0,9.27,4.43,0.42,0,0.67,0.75,1.17,4.85,0.25,0.08,0.58,0.5,3.51,3.43,0,0.08,6.27,0.5,1.17,2.01,3.09,0,1.25,0.08,0,0,0,0.08,0.33,0.33,0.17,0.08,0.08,0.67,0,0.08,0,0.33,0.67,0.25,3.76,9.86,0.58,1.84,6.77,0.5,0.25,0.17,2.51,2.26,4.01,0.33,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.13,3.76,6.1,0.17,0.08,1.09,6.93,0,0.17,0,0.25,0,0,3.36,3.52,2.95,3.23,2.53,-1.7,-0.37,0.4,-0.13,-0.8,0.17,0.5,0.25,0.42,0.92,0,0.67,0,0.75,0,0,0,0.75,0.17,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,1.55,1.25,15.66,150.38,0.92,342.52,-0.42,125.31,1,133.67,0.84,125.31,-1.25,342.52,0.84,367.59,0,183.79,-0.17,0,0,25.06,0,33.42,108.6,125.31,8.35,8.35,100.25,-0.17,217.21,50.13,8.35,41.77,33.42,0.33,0,58.48,16.71,125.31,33.42,8.35,0,1.09,1,0,0.5,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0.08,0.17,0,1

11/3/15,19,Trail Blazers,"Abbott, Clinton, celebrities join Twitter fight over Houston gay rights ordinance ","
AUSTIN ‚ÄìTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton clashed on Twitter over whether Houston voters on Tuesday should reject or uphold a city ordinance that bans discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodations that is based on, among other things, sexual orientation and gender identity.
The so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, has attracted national attention and a dollar-fueled TV ad blitz.
HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.
- Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 2, 2015
Social conservatives such as Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Family Research Council president Tony Perkins call it the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance.‚Äù They say transgender people could cause problems ‚Äî especially if someone born a man who has a sex change uses the women‚Äôs restroom.
But it‚Äôs about more than potty security, Perkins blogged. He called it a ‚Äúradical measure, which punishes people who refuse to celebrate transgenderism and homosexuality with massive fines.‚Äù Perkins called the ordinance part of a ‚Äúnationwide march to silence religious liberty in America.‚Äù
Clinton, her opponent Bernie Sanders and Houston Mayor Annise Parker have endorsed retention of HERO, which has been the subject of a protracted legal and political battle. They say it simply would bring long-overdue, equal treatment to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. Supporters have deplored opponents‚Äô many TV commercials about bathrooms as attempts to scare Houstonians and exploit many people‚Äôs lack of familiarity with transgender people and their struggles.
.@GregAbbott_TX is right about one thing: equality is one of Hillary's values. Houston‚Äîvote #YesOnProp1 today. https://t.co/AI0IWnqhB7
- Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 3, 2015
Famous athletes and movie stars have lent their names to the opposing sides.
Weighing in against the ordinance was former Houston Astro and Texas Ranger slugger Lance Berkman. Once known as ‚ÄúThe Big Puma,‚Äù he said he‚Äôs now speaking as the concerned father of four daughters. Berkman taped a TV ad urging rejection of the ordinance, and social conservative activist Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values tweeted about it:
#Houston baseball #HERO Lance Berkman says vote ""no"" on Houston bathroom ordinance local prop 1, https://t.co/Klm1YZW4wK #txlege #tcot
- Jonathan Saenz (@jonathansaenzTX) November 3, 2015
On the opposing side, Oscar-winning actress Sally Field appeared with supporters of the ordinance at a press conference in Houston late last week. Here‚Äôs a photo shared on Twitter by gay rights activist Chuck Smith of Equality Texas, who regularly does battle with Saenz‚Äô group at the Texas Capitol:
Sally Field: ""A vote for #HERO is a vote to treat everyone fairly and equally under the law."" #YesOnProp1 pic.twitter.com/oGD4NI9G3p - Houston Unites (@Houston_Unites) October 29, 2015
Big corporations with a presence in Houston, such as Apple, Hewlett Packard, General Electric and Dow Chemical have urged support for the ordinance. They warn that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote would take down protections for racial and religious minorities as well as for LGBT residents. Also, Houston would be the nation‚Äôs largest city without an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting all of those subcategories of the population.
In a statement, Apple said voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù would send ‚Äúa clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity.‚Äù
As my colleague Bobby Blanchard noted here Monday, participation in early voting in Harris County topped all other urban counties. Experts said as many as 250,000 Houston residents might cast ballots in an election that includes not just the culture war battle but a hotly contested mayor‚Äôs race. In Houston‚Äôs last open-seat mayor‚Äôs race six years ago, only about 178,000 people voted.
Political scientists don‚Äôt know whether the choice of starkly different mayoral candidates ‚Äî different in race and ideology ‚Äî or the hubbub about gay rights and bathrooms drove the bigger turnout in Houston.

Gay rights advocates in Michigan and across the country will be watching today's election results from Houston, where a local nondiscrimination proposal has become a proxy war between the national movement and its critics.
""This is the biggest example yet of what happens when we put our rights up for a vote like this,"" said Stephanie White, executive director of Equality Michigan.
The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance seeks to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, along with a host of other criteria, including race, religion, sex and military status.
It's the most prominent gay rights vote of its kind since a June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which declared that same-sex couples have a fundamental right to marriage, and the campaign in the country's fourth largest city has been combative.
Critics have dubbed the proposal the ""bathroom ordinance,"" focusing on protections it would extend to transgender residents. A controversial attack ad suggested that ""any man, any time"" -- including a registered sex offender -- could enter a women's restroom if the proposal passes, and the commercial ended with an ominous image of a young girl walking into a bathroom stall.
""I think it's despicable,"" said Amy Hunter, Trans Advocacy Coordinator for the ACLU of Michigan. ""It preys on people's worst fears, and none of them are well founded.""
Hunter noted that 17 states and more than 200 municipalities -- including dozens in Michigan -- have similar anti-discrimination protections in place.
""And there has been no uptick in sexual assaults in women's restrooms,"" she said. ""It's an easy way to demonize people and distract from the fact that these kind of measures are really about protecting people.""
While LGBT groups say the attack ads are misleading, they also acknowledge the messaging has been effective.
The Houston proposal polled well initially, but support has dropped despite higher spending by supporters. Many now consider it a toss up.
""It's sobering, to say at least,"" said White.
The opposition group, which argues that its standing up for ""women's privacy,"" has also aired ads featuring former Houston Astros baseball player Lance Berkman, who is urging local voters to reject the measure.

11/3/15,19,Trail Blazers,"Abbott, Clinton, celebrities join Twitter fight over Houston gay rights ordinance ","AUSTIN ‚ÄìTexas Gov. Greg Abbott and Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton clashed on Twitter over whether Houston voters on Tuesday should reject or uphold a city ordinance that bans discrimination in jobs, housing and public accommodations that is based on, among other things, sexual orientation and gender identity.
The so-called Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO, has attracted national attention and a dollar-fueled TV ad blitz.
HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.
- Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) November 2, 2015
Social conservatives such as Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Family Research Council president Tony Perkins call it the ‚Äúbathroom ordinance.‚Äù They say transgender people could cause problems ‚Äî especially if someone born a man who has a sex change uses the women‚Äôs restroom.
But it‚Äôs about more than potty security, Perkins blogged. He called it a ‚Äúradical measure, which punishes people who refuse to celebrate transgenderism and homosexuality with massive fines.‚Äù Perkins called the ordinance part of a ‚Äúnationwide march to silence religious liberty in America.‚Äù
Clinton, her opponent Bernie Sanders and Houston Mayor Annise Parker have endorsed retention of HERO, which has been the subject of a protracted legal and political battle. They say it simply would bring long-overdue, equal treatment to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. Supporters have deplored opponents‚Äô many TV commercials about bathrooms as attempts to scare Houstonians and exploit many people‚Äôs lack of familiarity with transgender people and their struggles.

Famous athletes and movie stars have lent their names to the opposing sides.
Weighing in against the ordinance was former Houston Astro and Texas Ranger slugger Lance Berkman. Once known as ‚ÄúThe Big Puma,‚Äù he said he‚Äôs now speaking as the concerned father of four daughters. Berkman taped a TV ad urging rejection of the ordinance, and social conservative activist Jonathan Saenz of Texas Values tweeted about it:

On the opposing side, Oscar-winning actress Sally Field appeared with supporters of the ordinance at a press conference in Houston late last week. Here‚Äôs a photo shared on Twitter by gay rights activist Chuck Smith of Equality Texas, who regularly does battle with Saenz‚Äô group at the Texas Capitol:

Big corporations with a presence in Houston, such as Apple, Hewlett Packard, General Electric and Dow Chemical have urged support for the ordinance. They warn that a ‚Äúno‚Äù vote would take down protections for racial and religious minorities as well as for LGBT residents. Also, Houston would be the nation‚Äôs largest city without an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting all of those subcategories of the population.
In a statement, Apple said voting ‚Äúyes‚Äù would send ‚Äúa clear message that Houston is focused on a future of inclusion, diversity and continued prosperity.‚Äù
As my colleague Bobby Blanchard noted here Monday, participation in early voting in Harris County topped all other urban counties. Experts said as many as 250,000 Houston residents might cast ballots in an election that includes not just the culture war battle but a hotly contested mayor‚Äôs race. In Houston‚Äôs last open-seat mayor‚Äôs race six years ago, only about 178,000 people voted.

Despite more than $10 million invested in the Houston mayor's race, it is the city's polarizing equal rights ordinance that appears to be driving voters to the polls, a pattern that is expected to continue today as residents cast ballots for city and school races, county bonds and state constitutional amendments.
Approximately 130,000 city voters cast early ballots, more than doubling pre-Election Day turnout in Houston's last open-seat mayor's race six years ago.
Political observers largely attributed that uptick to interest in the law known as HERO, which has attracted national endorsements and a series of six-figure checks.
""The mayor's race never really took off,"" local Democratic strategist Keir Murray said. ""That leads me to conclude that it's HERO that's been doing it.""
A broad field of experienced candidates awash in early money brought expectations of a high-profile fight to succeed term-limited Mayor Annise Parker.
Polls consistently have placed state Rep. Sylvester Turner in an expected December runoff. Former Kemah mayor and businessman Bill King and former Harris County sheriff Adrian Garcia are expected to fight it out for the second runoff spot. Other top-tier candidates in the 13-person field include City Councilman Steve Costello, former Congressman Chris Bell and former city attorney Ben Hall.
During their budding campaigns, the half-dozen major candidates focused on fundraising as they appeared at a series of special- interest forums, collectively harping on the need for infrastructure improvements, pension reform and investment in public safety.
Just as the race was ramping up, however, the Texas Supreme Court in late July ordered the city to repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance or put it to voters on the November ballot. City Council voted to place it on Tuesday's ballot two weeks later.
Proposition 1 asks voters if they favor an ordinance that ""prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy.""
Opponents have seized on the ordinance's protections for gay and transgender residents, alleging it would allow men, including sexual predators, into women's restrooms. Supporters call that preposterous and an attempt to capitalize on public ignorance about transgender residents.
While Election Day voters and early voters typically hail from different sections of the electorate, this fall's early tallies show a clear trend of robust turnout in conservative strongholds and solid numbers in black neighborhoods.
Kingwood, in particular, has posted high vote totals, as have Clear Lake and the conservative west side corridor south of Interstate 10 and north of Westheimer, which is council District G.
These GOP bastions are followed by largely African-American areas in the south and southwest, near Fort Bend County, and in the northwest, near mayoral front-runner Turner's native neighborhood of Acres Homes.
""HERO would seem to be the most likely explanation for the increase in turnout, followed by the larger number of viable candidates and the greater amount of money spent on advertising and voter outreach,"" Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said.
Ideological diversity
Texas Southern University political scientist Michael Adams offered a different view, suggesting the racial and ideological diversity of this year's mayoral pool also could explain the uptick in turnout.
""This is the first time since 2003 that we've seen this type of split based upon what I call politics and race,"" Adams said. ""What seems to be driving the turnout seems to be that you have these choices that are based on race and also ... ideology.""
In light of higher-than-expected early voting, political scientists are now projecting as many as 250,000 city voters will cast ballots. More than 985,000 Houston residents are registered.
Groups on both sides of the HERO fight said they will be working until the polls close to keep up the momentum of early voting.
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for the anti-HERO Campaign for Houston, said Election Day will see his forces working the phones to encourage voters to head to the polls and deploy teams at poling locations with signs and push cards, in addition to ongoing TV and radio ads.
A supportive group called the Black Robe Regiment out of San Antonio distributed packets of information to at least 400 local churches Sunday in the hopes of encouraging the pastors to preach against the ordinance. That effort was bolstered on Monday by high-profile statements against the ordinance from Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton.
""We've had a high turnout for early voting, but we want to finish strong and make sure there's no voter left behind,"" Woodfill said. ""It's important that we push, push, push all day to 7 p.m. We had to fight to earn the right to vote, and tomorrow we'll finally be crossing the finish line of this marathon we started two years ago."" Richard Carlbom, spokesman for the pro- HERO group Houston Unites, was equally confident, saying hundreds of volunteers will hit the streets at 6 a.m., going door to door and working phones. Carlbom said the campaign also will staff several dozen precincts with poll watchers, and have a team of volunteers and faith leaders ready to deploy to polling locations should tensions arise.
""We plan on canvassing large parts of the city to turn out every last voter we can find who wants to vote yes on Prop. 1, and really pushing for a very large turnout on Election Day,"" Carlbom said. ""One of the things we've known from the beginning is voters who haven't voted consistently in a municipal election are more likely to be with us. And we know our turnout operation will be stronger than theirs. We're going to be operating on all cylinders tomorrow.""
Last week, the ordinance picked up support from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well as actors and Fortune 500 companies.
Advocacy groups wrote the largest checks on HERO's behalf, which included more than $619,000 from the Human Rights Campaign, more than $562,000 from the ACLU of Texas, more than $346,000 from the Washington, D.C.-based Freedom for All Americans, and $250,000 from both the New York-based American Unity Fund and Colorado's Gill Action.
Texans contribute
Opponents, meanwhile, drew top dollars from individual Texas donors, including more than $206,000 from Houston real estate executive Allen Hartman, more than $146,000 from GOP kingmaker Dr. Steve Hotze, $26,000 from the committee to support Harris County Commissioner Jack Cagle, and $25,000 each from Houston attorney Jack Little, Kingwood executive Paul Sarvadi and Schulenburg's Ralph Schmidt.
The Houston-based Trinity Equity Partners I, LP also chipped in $50,000. These totals include in-kind donations and loans.
""It's a much more emotional and, in some ways, given the ads that have been run, a sensational issue,"" Murray said of HERO, comparing it to the mayor's race.

11/3/15,19,Politics,"Marijuana, transgender issue top ballot initiatives in low-key election ","
An unconventional marijuana legalization question in Ohio and a transgender bathroom measure in Houston are drawing the lion's share of attention in an otherwise low-key election for ballot initiatives.
Ohio's Issue 3 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, but with a twist: the measure would also create a cultivation monopoly for 10 property owners who are also heavy donors to the campaign.
Even some pot aficionados say they are uncomfortable with the preferential treatment embedded in Issue 3, which if passed would make Ohio the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana, and the only state to do so without first approving a medical market.
Foes of the measure have swung back with Issue 2, a measure placed on the ballot by the state legislature that would nullify Issue 3 and also ban ballot measures that promote monopolies. A legal battle is expected to ensue if both proposed constitutional amendments pass.
With that in mind, the Cincinnati Enquirer advised voters in an Oct. 18 editorial to reject both initiatives, saying that ""Ohioans don't need Issue 2 to save ourselves from Issue 3, ""while the Cleveland Plain Dealer urged a ""no"" vote on Issue 3, calling it ""weed greed.""
""Even pro-legalization groups such as the Green and Libertarian parties of Ohio oppose Issue 3, saying it represents crony capitalism,"" said the Plain Dealer in an Oct. 29 editorial.
So far neither measure is polling over 50 percent, according to a University of Akron survey released Oct. 21, which found voters in favor of Issue 2 by a margin of 40 to 28 percentage points and split on Issue 3 at 46 to 46 percent.
""One thing is for sure ‚Äî all eyes are on Ohio this week,"" said Oregon activist Johnny Green on the Weed Blog.
Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project and architect of Colorado's successful 2012 recreational marijuana campaign, said his organization has not taken a position on Issue 3.
""We support the measure to the extent that it would end marijuana prohibition and replace it with a system in which marijuana is regulated similarly to alcohol, but it is up to voters to decide whether the system it proposes is the right one for Ohio,"" said Mr. Tvert.
In Houston, gay rights groups have pumped millions into passing Proposition 1, an equal rights ordinance that would make it illegal to stop transgender people from using public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.
The opposition, led by Houston pastors and conservative groups, has scored with alarming ads saying that the ordinance would allow male sex predators to use women's restrooms, showers and locker rooms. One television spot shows a man cornering a little girl in a bathroom stall.
Those in support of Proposition 1 have argued that the measure does nothing to change laws that prohibit indecent exposure, harassment and assaults. Instead, proponents have framed the measure as an anti-discrimination ordinance that would protect a broad class of people, including veterans and pregnant women.
Companies like Apple and Hewlett-Packard ""know that Houston needs an equal rights ordinance in order to attract and retain top talent ‚Äî and send a message that the city is truly open for business to everyone,"" according to the pro-Proposition 1 campaign Houston Unites.
Meanwhile, the Campaign for Houston, which opposes Proposition 1, received a shoutout Monday from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who urged Houstonians to vote ""no"" on the measure.
""No men in women's bathrooms,"" said Mr. Abbott, a Republican on Twitter.",Houston Unites,1,581,93.84,46.16,4.52,11.47,25.26,26.51,78.49,52.5,42.34,6.02,1.2,0,0.34,0,0.17,0.34,4.82,14.46,8.95,5.51,13.94,4.82,2.07,4.99,1.2,10.67,3.96,3.1,6.71,0.86,0.86,4.99,9.81,1.38,8.43,0.86,1.55,1.89,0.52,0.17,3.27,0,3.96,1.55,2.41,0.52,0,0.52,0.17,0.17,0,0,11.7,7.23,0.86,0.34,1.55,0.34,2.75,5.16,0.17,0.17,0.69,1.2,3.27,2.58,0,0.69,4.65,1.2,0.34,2.07,1.03,0.17,2.58,0.52,0,0,0,1.38,0.52,0.17,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.17,0.52,0.17,3.79,6.37,0.34,0.86,4.48,0.52,0,0.17,1.38,2.75,3.1,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,14.97,4.3,5.51,0,0,1.03,4.13,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,3.27,3.37,3.17,3.48,2.73,-1.92,-0.25,0.6,-0.26,-0.96,0.17,0.34,0.17,0.34,1.03,0,1.03,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0.69,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,1.82,1.51,17.84,137.69,1.38,292.6,-0.86,240.96,1.55,51.64,0.34,137.69,-1.38,189.33,0,533.56,0,240.96,0.17,17.21,0.17,0,0,34.42,68.85,137.69,206.54,68.85,68.85,0,86.06,103.27,0,34.42,51.64,-0.17,0,137.69,0,51.64,86.06,51.64,0,2.75,1,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0.17,0.34,0,1
11/3/15,19,Domestic,Houston equal rights measure in hands of voters ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston is in the hands of voters after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
Houston residents were voting Tuesday on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which supporters say would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but would also provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
""I voted yes because I believe (in) opportunity for all individuals and I believe that the people that vote no are going to be on the wrong side of history,"" Anna Bakken said Tuesday outside a polling site.
Opponents of the ordinance planned to reach out to voters Tuesday at polling locations and through social media, phones calls and emails, said Jared Woodfill, a spokesman for Campaign for Houston.
Those against the ordinance, including a coalition of conservative pastors, have said it infringes on their religious beliefs regarding homosexuality. But in the months leading up to Tuesday's vote, opponents have focused their campaign on highlighting one part of the ordinance related to the use of public bathrooms by transgender men and women that opponents allege would open the door for sexual predators to go into women's restrooms.
""I don't know why anyone would think that men going into a women's bathroom or swimming pool or locker room would be a good idea,"" Susan Hunter, who voted against the ordinance, said Tuesday. ""It's not safe and these people need to find another solution.""
Democratic Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who is gay, and other supporters of the ordinance have called this ""bathroom ordinance"" strategy highly misleading and a scare tactic.
The ordinance was initially approved by the Houston City Council in May 2014 but a lawsuit to have residents vote on the measure eventually made it to the Texas Supreme Court, which in July ordered the city to either repeal the ordinance or put it on the ballot.
Tuesday's referendum has drawn attention from around the nation, with the measure getting high-profile endorsements last week from the White House, high-tech giant Apple and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton. The ordinance also has received support from other members of Houston's religious community.
Woodfill said opponents of the ordinance have included a diverse group of individuals, including pastors from all denominations and local and state elected officials.
On Monday, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted his support for opponents, saying, ""HOUSTON: Vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values. Vote NO on City of Houston Proposition 1. No men in women's bathrooms.""

11/3/15,19,Domestic,Houston equal rights measure in hands of voters ,"
HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî An ordinance that would establish nondiscrimination protections for gay and transgender people in Houston is in the hands of voters after a nearly 18-month battle that spawned rallies, legal fights and accusations of both religious intolerance and demonization of the LGBT community.
Houston residents were voting Tuesday on the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which supporters say would not only offer increased protections for gay and transgender people, but would also provide a wealth of protections against discrimination based on sex, race, age, religion and other categories.
""I voted yes because I believe (in) opportunity for all individuals and I believe that the people that vote no are going to be on the wrong side of history,"" Anna Bakken said Tuesday outside a polling site.

Despite more than $10 million invested in the Houston mayor's race, it is the city's polarizing equal rights ordinance that appears to be driving voters to the polls, a pattern that is expected to continue today as residents cast ballots for city and school races, county bonds and state constitutional amendments.
Approximately 130,000 city voters cast early ballots, more than doubling pre-Election Day turnout in Houston's last open-seat mayor's race six years ago.
Political observers largely attributed that uptick to interest in the law known as HERO, which has attracted national endorsements and a series of six-figure checks.
""The mayor's race never really took off,"" local Democratic strategist Keir Murray said. ""That leads me to conclude that it's HERO that's been doing it.""
A broad field of experienced candidates awash in early money brought expectations of a high-profile fight to succeed term-limited Mayor Annise Parker.
Polls consistently have placed state Rep. Sylvester Turner in an expected December runoff. Former Kemah mayor and businessman Bill King and former Harris County sheriff Adrian Garcia are expected to fight it out for the second runoff spot. Other top-tier candidates in the 13-person field include City Councilman Steve Costello, former Congressman Chris Bell and former city attorney Ben Hall.
During their budding campaigns, the half-dozen major candidates focused on fundraising as they appeared at a series of special- interest forums, collectively harping on the need for infrastructure improvements, pension reform and investment in public safety.
Just as the race was ramping up, however, the Texas Supreme Court in late July ordered the city to repeal the nondiscrimination ordinance or put it to voters on the November ballot. City Council voted to place it on Tuesday's ballot two weeks later.
Proposition 1 asks voters if they favor an ordinance that ""prohibits discrimination in city employment and city services, city contracts, public accommodations, private employment, and housing based on an individual's sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity, or pregnancy.""
Opponents have seized on the ordinance's protections for gay and transgender residents, alleging it would allow men, including sexual predators, into women's restrooms. Supporters call that preposterous and an attempt to capitalize on public ignorance about transgender residents.
While Election Day voters and early voters typically hail from different sections of the electorate, this fall's early tallies show a clear trend of robust turnout in conservative strongholds and solid numbers in black neighborhoods.
Kingwood, in particular, has posted high vote totals, as have Clear Lake and the conservative west side corridor south of Interstate 10 and north of Westheimer, which is council District G.
These GOP bastions are followed by largely African-American areas in the south and southwest, near Fort Bend County, and in the northwest, near mayoral front-runner Turner's native neighborhood of Acres Homes.
""HERO would seem to be the most likely explanation for the increase in turnout, followed by the larger number of viable candidates and the greater amount of money spent on advertising and voter outreach,"" Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said.
Ideological diversity
Texas Southern University political scientist Michael Adams offered a different view, suggesting the racial and ideological diversity of this year's mayoral pool also could explain the uptick in turnout.
""This is the first time since 2003 that we've seen this type of split based upon what I call politics and race,"" Adams said. ""What seems to be driving the turnout seems to be that you have these choices that are based on race and also ... ideology.""
In light of higher-than-expected early voting, political scientists are now projecting as many as 250,000 city voters will cast ballots. More than 985,000 Houston residents are registered.
Groups on both sides of the HERO fight said they will be working until the polls close to keep up the momentum of early voting.
Jared Woodfill, spokesman for the anti-HERO Campaign for Houston, said Election Day will see his forces working the phones to encourage voters to head to the polls and deploy teams at poling locations with signs and push cards, in addition to ongoing TV and radio ads.
A supportive group called the Black Robe Regiment out of San Antonio distributed packets of information to at least 400 local churches Sunday in the hopes of encouraging the pastors to preach against the ordinance. That effort was bolstered on Monday by high-profile statements against the ordinance from Gov. Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton.
""We've had a high turnout for early voting, but we want to finish strong and make sure there's no voter left behind,"" Woodfill said. ""It's important that we push, push, push all day to 7 p.m. We had to fight to earn the right to vote, and tomorrow we'll finally be crossing the finish line of this marathon we started two years ago."" Richard Carlbom, spokesman for the pro- HERO group Houston Unites, was equally confident, saying hundreds of volunteers will hit the streets at 6 a.m., going door to door and working phones. Carlbom said the campaign also will staff several dozen precincts with poll watchers, and have a team of volunteers and faith leaders ready to deploy to polling locations should tensions arise.
""We plan on canvassing large parts of the city to turn out every last voter we can find who wants to vote yes on Prop. 1, and really pushing for a very large turnout on Election Day,"" Carlbom said. ""One of the things we've known from the beginning is voters who haven't voted consistently in a municipal election are more likely to be with us. And we know our turnout operation will be stronger than theirs. We're going to be operating on all cylinders tomorrow.""
Last week, the ordinance picked up support from Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, as well as actors and Fortune 500 companies.
Advocacy groups wrote the largest checks on HERO's behalf, which included more than $619,000 from the Human Rights Campaign, more than $562,000 from the ACLU of Texas, more than $346,000 from the Washington, D.C.-based Freedom for All Americans, and $250,000 from both the New York-based American Unity Fund and Colorado's Gill Action.
Texans contribute
Opponents, meanwhile, drew top dollars from individual Texas donors, including more than $206,000 from Houston real estate executive Allen Hartman, more than $146,000 from GOP kingmaker Dr. Steve Hotze, $26,000 from the committee to support Harris County Commissioner Jack Cagle, and $25,000 each from Houston attorney Jack Little, Kingwood executive Paul Sarvadi and Schulenburg's Ralph Schmidt.
The Houston-based Trinity Equity Partners I, LP also chipped in $50,000. These totals include in-kind donations and loans.
""It's a much more emotional and, in some ways, given the ads that have been run, a sensational issue,"" Murray said of HERO, comparing it to the mayor's race.

11/3/15,19,Elections ,What to watch for around the country on Election Day 2015 ‚Äî VIDEO ,"Even as Americans remain transfixed by Donald Trump and the feisty presidential contest that won't actually be decided for another 12 months, Election Day this year arrived Tuesday with plenty at stake.
Voters across the country are heading to the polls to make their picks in local elections, a couple of governors' races, and on dozens of important ‚Äî and sometimes quirky ‚Äî ballot measures in the off-year election.
In Kentucky, the closely fought battle for governor in one of 2015's most-watched contests pits wealthy tea party favorite Matt Bevin, who unsuccessfully took on Sen. Mitch McConnell, against Democratic Attorney General Jack Conway for the open seat. (McConnell is now backing Bevin.)
In Mississippi, incumbent Republican Gov. Phil Bryant looks set to win another term, although the contest has been pushed to the background by a clash over a constitutional amendment that would allow voters to sue the state to boost funding for public schools. In Virginia, Democrats are seeking to capture the state Senate, which Republicans now hold narrowly. And there are notable elections for mayor in Philadelphia, Houston and Salt Lake City.
Meanwhile, heated debate surrounding an effort to defeat a LGBT rights law in Texas could become hot fodder for the presidential candidates, a billionaire is backing a major effort to protect Big Game, and voters in Seattle are weighing a unique answer to the problem of money in politics.
Here are some of the issues being decided Tuesday and that are sure to be dissected in the aftermath as pols, pundits and the press look for clues to what the results all mean in the 2016 contest for the White House:
Houston: LGBT rights on the line down south
""No Men In Women's Bathrooms"" ‚Äî that's the rallying cry from opponents of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO), a law passed by the city last year to protect lesbian, gay and transgender people.
On Tuesday afternoon, the Clinton campaign joined the fray, responding to a baiting tweet from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, that urged Houston to ""vote Texas values, not @HillaryClinton values.""
Abbott, the Clinton campaign shot back, is ""right about one thing: equality is one of Hillary's values.""
In recent months, the campaign to undo HERO has become a focal point for the right, which has spent millions and recruited an assortment of local celebrities to their cause, including former Houston Astros star outfielder Lance Berkman.
""My wife and I have four daughters,"" Berkman says in an ad paid for by the Campaign for Houston PAC, which is seeking to repeal HERO. ""Proposition One would allow troubled men to enter women's public bathrooms, showers and locker rooms.""
Supporters of the ordinance have bristled at the claim, calling it fear-mongering against transgender men and women.
Ohio: An ex-boy band star tunes up for legalizing pot
Nick Lachey, the onetime lead singer of 98 Degrees, is headlining again --- but the attraction is a little different this time around.
Lachey and a group of investors are behind ResponsibleOhio, a group that is pushing an initiative to legalize marijuana for recreational use in the Buckeye State. The amendment would permit anyone 21 and older to hold up to an ounce of pot for personal use. With a $50 license, they can house eight ounces of harvested pot and four plants. If passed, Ohio would become the most populous state to legalize pot.
""Ohio is my home,"" Lachey says over some breezy tunes in ad produced by the pro-legalization group, ""and I care very deeply about the people here."" He promises jobs, a ""reinvigorated economy"" and a safer state.
Also on the pot front, Colorado voters are deciding what they want to do with the millions in revenue raised from its sale -- return the funds to taxpayers or use it to pay for school construction and other things.
Seattle: Trying to make elections more ""honest""
How would you like a coupon to spend on your favorite candidate?
That's what's on the table in Seattle with the ""Honest Elections"" referendum to diminish the influence of money in politics.
Backers of ""Initiative 122"" are seeking to radically remake how local campaigns are financed. Under the measure, voters would each be given $100 in ""democracy vouchers"" --- four each, at $25 per --- to be shelled out to the candidates of their choice.
It would also lower donation caps, ban contributions from corporations with significant city business interests, increase transparency and increase fines for electoral wrongdoing. Officials who leave office would also be required spend three years on the sidelines before becoming eligible to register as lobbyists.
Washington: A push to save endangered animals
This one's for Cecil the Lion, the big Zimbabwean cat killed in July by a dentist on safari from Minnesota.
This statewide ballot measure would criminalize ""selling, purchasing, trading, or distributing certain animal species threatened with extinction,"" raising the bar beyond where laws already on the books in New York, New Jersey and California have previously gone to protect Big Game.
The measure is the brainchild of billionaire Paul Allen, a Microsoft co-founder, who has sunk millions of dollars of his own money into the campaign.
Opponents, including the ""Legal Ivory Rights Coalition,"" say the proposal goes too far. ""It's Not What They Say It Is!"" blares the group's website, which warns that grandmas looking to pass along their ""antique"" ivory will be made into criminals.
Not complaining: Elephants and rhinoceroses -- often hunted for the ivory in their tusks and horns -- along with lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, marine turtles, and sharks that are among the threatened species that supporters say would be helped by the referendum.
Texas: The NRA is on the hunt
On the other hand, Texans with a taste for ""hunting, fishing and harvesting"" could get a constitutional boost on Tuesday, as the state goes to the polls to weigh in on its Proposition 6.
The amendment would make it more difficult for activist groups to push through new legislation or regulations aimed at expanding protections for animals or delicate ecosystems. The NRA is leading the way in lobbying for its passage with groups like the ""Dallas Safari Club"" also boosting the cause.
If the measure passes, Texas would become the 19th state to guarantee its residents a constitutional right to hunt and kill almost all manner of wildlife and the freedom catch and ""bag"" as many fish as they can haul back home.
San Francisco: Airbnb could get the boot Will Airbnb be kicked out of its hometown?
The vanguard of the so-called ""sharing economy"" is locking horns with the left again, as affordable housing activists in increasingly unaffordable San Francisco are angling to deal a blow to Airbnb.
This measure would impose a citywide ban on what's known as ""short-term rentals."" If approved, it would effectively cripple Airbnb, the profitable hub for homeowners and renters who profit from leasing out rooms or houses to travelers for, in most cases, below market rates.
The problem: Rent and home sale prices in San Francisco are skyrocketing, along with evictions, and critics say the fault lies, at least in part, with wealthy buyers who purchase housing for the express purpose of leasing it out for a quick profit.",Campaign for Houston ,1,1198,97.01,51,16.2,30.45,24.96,25.29,78.55,57.18,45.83,5.34,1.84,0.33,0,0.17,0.17,0.75,3.51,14.52,9.43,2.17,17.36,6.01,2.25,4.51,0.42,12.19,4.26,4.17,5.84,1,0.92,4.09,8.43,0.25,8.18,0.83,1.75,1.84,1,0.25,2.42,0,2.92,1.84,1.09,0.17,0,0.17,0.08,0,0.08,0,9.27,4.42,0.42,0,0.67,0.75,1.17,4.84,0.25,0.08,0.58,0.5,3.51,3.42,0,0.08,6.26,0.5,1.17,2,3.09,0,1.25,0.08,0,0,0,0.08,0.33,0.33,0.17,0.08,0.08,0.67,0,0.08,0,0.33,0.67,0.25,3.76,9.85,0.58,1.84,6.76,0.5,0.25,0.17,2.5,2.25,4.01,0.42,0.08,0.08,0,0,0,18.11,3.76,6.09,0.17,0.08,1.09,6.93,0,0.17,0,0.25,0,0,3.36,3.52,2.95,3.22,2.53,-1.69,-0.37,0.4,-0.13,-0.8,0.17,0.5,0.25,0.42,0.92,0,0.67,0,0.75,0,0,0,0.75,0.17,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,1.57,1.27,15.78,150.25,0.92,342.24,-0.42,125.21,1,141.9,0.92,125.21,-1.25,342.24,0.83,367.28,0,183.64,-0.17,0,0,25.04,0,33.39,108.51,133.56,8.35,8.35,100.17,-0.17,217.03,50.08,8.35,41.74,33.39,0.33,0,58.43,16.69,125.21,33.39,8.35,0,1.09,1,0,0.5,0.08,0,0,0,0,0.42,0,0.08,0.17,0,1
11/3/15,19,Politics,"Marijuana, transgender issue top ballot initiatives in low-key election ","
An unconventional marijuana legalization question in Ohio and a transgender bathroom measure in Houston are drawing the lion's share of attention in an otherwise low-key election for ballot initiatives.
Ohio's Issue 3 would legalize recreational marijuana for adults 21 and older, but with a twist: the measure would also create a cultivation monopoly for 10 property owners who are also heavy donors to the campaign.
Even some pot aficionados say they are uncomfortable with the preferential treatment embedded in Issue 3, which if passed would make Ohio the fifth state to legalize recreational marijuana, and the only state to do so without first approving a medical market.
Foes of the measure have swung back with Issue 2, a measure placed on the ballot by the state legislature that would nullify Issue 3 and also ban ballot measures that promote monopolies. A legal battle is expected to ensue if both proposed constitutional amendments pass.
With that in mind, the Cincinnati Enquirer advised voters in an Oct. 18 editorial to reject both initiatives, saying that ""Ohioans don't need Issue 2 to save ourselves from Issue 3, ""while the Cleveland Plain Dealer urged a ""no"" vote on Issue 3, calling it ""weed greed.""
""Even pro-legalization groups such as the Green and Libertarian parties of Ohio oppose Issue 3, saying it represents crony capitalism,"" said the Plain Dealer in an Oct. 29 editorial.
So far neither measure is polling over 50 percent, according to a University of Akron survey released Oct. 21, which found voters in favor of Issue 2 by a margin of 40 to 28 percentage points and split on Issue 3 at 46 to 46 percent.
""One thing is for sure ‚Äî all eyes are on Ohio this week,"" said Oregon activist Johnny Green on the Weed Blog.
Mason Tvert, spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project and architect of Colorado's successful 2012 recreational marijuana campaign, said his organization has not taken a position on Issue 3.
""We support the measure to the extent that it would end marijuana prohibition and replace it with a system in which marijuana is regulated similarly to alcohol, but it is up to voters to decide whether the system it proposes is the right one for Ohio,"" said Mr. Tvert.
In Houston, gay rights groups have pumped millions into passing Proposition 1, an equal rights ordinance that would make it illegal to stop transgender people from using public restrooms that correspond with their gender identity.
The opposition, led by Houston pastors and conservative groups, has scored with alarming ads saying that the ordinance would allow male sex predators to use women's restrooms, showers and locker rooms. One television spot shows a man cornering a little girl in a bathroom stall.
Those in support of Proposition 1 have argued that the measure does nothing to change laws that prohibit indecent exposure, harassment and assaults. Instead, proponents have framed the measure as an anti-discrimination ordinance that would protect a broad class of people, including veterans and pregnant women.
Companies like Apple and Hewlett-Packard ""know that Houston needs an equal rights ordinance in order to attract and retain top talent ‚Äî and send a message that the city is truly open for business to everyone,"" according to the pro-Proposition 1 campaign Houston Unites.
Meanwhile, the Campaign for Houston, which opposes Proposition 1, received a shoutout Monday from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who urged Houstonians to vote ""no"" on the measure.
""No men in women's bathrooms,"" said Mr. Abbott, a Republican on Twitter.",Campaign for Houston ,1,581,93.84,46.16,4.52,11.47,25.26,26.51,78.49,52.5,42.34,6.02,1.2,0,0.34,0,0.17,0.34,4.82,14.46,8.95,5.51,13.94,4.82,2.07,4.99,1.2,10.67,3.96,3.1,6.71,0.86,0.86,4.99,9.81,1.38,8.43,0.86,1.55,1.89,0.52,0.17,3.27,0,3.96,1.55,2.41,0.52,0,0.52,0.17,0.17,0,0,11.7,7.23,0.86,0.34,1.55,0.34,2.75,5.16,0.17,0.17,0.69,1.2,3.27,2.58,0,0.69,4.65,1.2,0.34,2.07,1.03,0.17,2.58,0.52,0,0,0,1.38,0.52,0.17,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.17,0.52,0.17,3.79,6.37,0.34,0.86,4.48,0.52,0,0.17,1.38,2.75,3.1,0.52,0,0,0,0,0,14.97,4.3,5.51,0,0,1.03,4.13,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,3.27,3.37,3.17,3.48,2.73,-1.92,-0.25,0.6,-0.26,-0.96,0.17,0.34,0.17,0.34,1.03,0,1.03,0,0.34,0.17,0,0.17,0.69,0,0.34,0,0,0,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,1.82,1.51,17.84,137.69,1.38,292.6,-0.86,240.96,1.55,51.64,0.34,137.69,-1.38,189.33,0,533.56,0,240.96,0.17,17.21,0.17,0,0,34.42,68.85,137.69,206.54,68.85,68.85,0,86.06,103.27,0,34.42,51.64,-0.17,0,137.69,0,51.64,86.06,51.64,0,2.75,1,0,1.03,0,0,0,0,0,0.86,0,0.17,0.34,0,1

11/2/15,19,The Scoop,Opponents reduce Houston equal rights ordinance to a dirty bathroom myth ,"It must be something in Houston‚Äôs water ‚Äì specifically running through the public restroom taps ‚Äì that interferes with the brain‚Äôs ability to process simple language.
There‚Äôs just no other explanation for the fact that thousands of voters will swarm the polls there Tuesday not only disagreeing on how they‚Äôll vote, but with a bizarre disconnect on what they‚Äôre even voting about.
Many people grasp that Houston‚Äôs Proposition 1 (Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO) is really a catch-up measure intended to bring the city into the modern era of basic rights protections. They will be voting on a broad non-discrimination ordinance, similar to the one we have had in Dallas for 13 years now with no ill-effects.
But some of our friends down in the Bayou City seem to earnestly believe that what they are voting on is this: UNISEX BATHROOMS. It‚Äôs a flashing alarm in their heads just like that, a scary red warning sign in all capital letters.
Apparently, when you take a routine civil-protections measure and feed it through the big anti-LGBT scarification machine what you get is the possibility that men might pee in the ladies room.
And not just any men, either. We‚Äôre talking about scary demented sex predator perverts, sharing the very same stalls with sweet little pig-tailed girls in their little plaid schoolgirl uniforms, or with modest elderly grandmas who use their lavender-scented hankies to avoid touching germy toilet handles with bare hands.
If that sounds like a creepy porn video, it‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what this is. It‚Äôs a stupid, sick fantasy cooked up by the same hysteria- mongers who think same-sex marriage is a plot to turn their kids gay, or that gender identity is something you put on like a pair of socks. It is a product of profound ignorance.
Rivals though we historically are, I feel a bit sorry for the large segment of the Houston population that has not lost their collective minds over this issue. All they want is to have the same common-sense protections as Dallas, Fort Worth, El Paso, San Antonio, countless other major American cities and nearly half the states in the U.S.
They want the same basic non-discrimination guidelines that many major employers, tour promoters and relocation consultants expect in the places they do business.
Houston‚Äôs proposed ordinance, which was adopted by the City Council last year ‚Äì but suspended pending Tuesday‚Äôs vote ‚Äì bars discrimination based on more than a dozen categories including race, age, religion, military status, and whether you‚Äôre pregnant. The idea is to make sure people don‚Äôt lose their jobs for being gay, or kept out of nightclubs because they‚Äôre old, or barred from pancake restaurants because they‚Äôre Muslim, or any of the other petty, idiotic slights that people impose against one another based on irrational bias and fear.
Almost all of that has been ignored, however, by HERO opponents. Instead, they homed in like laser-guided tracer bullets on just two of the categories on which discrimination is prohibited ‚Äì sexual orientation and gender identity. Then they took the entire discussion, quite literally, to the toilet.
‚ÄúNo Men In Women‚Äôs Bathrooms‚Äù! is the overwrought rallying cry around which opponents have gathered, like frightened cavemen huddled around the safety of the campfire. It‚Äôs funny, but it‚Äôs even more stupid. And stupid as it is, it‚Äôs yet more offensive.
An unpleasantly prurient anti-Prop 1 television ad takes these revolting fears considerably further than that. The black-and-white ad shows a menacing public restroom with leaky faucets and fizzing fluorescent lights. In comes a sweet little girl in ankle socks and patent-leather mary janes. Before she can modestly go about her business, a large male body looms into the frame, crowding the terrified child into the grimy stall.
How the basic American business of ensuring everybody receives a fair shake gets perverted into an image of a man crowding a little girl into a toilet stall is beyond my powers of invention, but it has clearly resonated with somebody. Astoundingly, some pollsters now believe this routine ordinance (which has been on the books in Dallas ‚Äì remember? ‚Äì for 13 years without an outbreak of public bathroom assaults) may fail, due to this graphic campaign of shock-and-lies.
I have said this before, because I love Texas (I have a soft spot for Houston, too) and I hate it when we look like we‚Äôre out of our gourds. This isn‚Äôt about liberal-versus-conservative; it‚Äôs about candor versus a pack of ugly, dirty-minded lies.
To date, nobody ‚Äì not a single single police official or rape-crisis counselor in any Texas or U.S. city with a similar ordinance ‚Äì has described a rash of sex predators claiming transgender status in order to gain access to women‚Äôs bathrooms. The ‚Äúbathroom predator‚Äù is an ugly, made-up myth.

Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Actors Matt Bomer and Eva Longoria. Fortune 500 companies Apple and Hewlett-Packard.
From Capitol Hill to Hollywood to Silicon Valley, a number of nationally known figures are expressing support for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO. Their voices emerged last week as early voting drew to an end, and a close battle over the proposition was still predicted ahead of Tuesday's vote.
Proponents have hailed the proposition as an overdue ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as sex, race and other classifications. Opponents have characterized it as a dangerous move that would allow men dressed in women's clothing to enter women's restrooms and commit sexual assaults - actions that are banned by existing laws.
Locally, the fight has played out on living room television screens and front doorsteps, as dramatic ads aired and volunteers made calls and went knocking door to door. Mayoral candidates have debated the issue, brought forward by and passed under Mayor Annise Parker - the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city - before a state Supreme Court decision landed it on the November ballot. Notable Texas figures such as Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, former Astros player Lance Berkman and Texans owner Bob McNair (who ultimately rescinded his financial support) already had aligned themselves against the ordinance. Last week, celebrities took to Twitter in support of the measure, using the hashtags #HERO and #YesOnProp1. The social media messages were widely shared.
""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love - I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond,"" Clinton tweeted Thursday, signing off with ""-H"" said to indicate she wrote it personally.
White House spokesman Jeff Tiller on Thursday said President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, though not formally endorsing the Houston measure, were ""confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality,"" according to an article by BuzzFeed. (The @VP and @POTUS accounts, however, were silent on the matter.)
A tweet from Sanders' account followed on Friday.
""In many states, it is legal to fire someone for being gay or to deny someone housing for being transgender,"" read the Sanders tweet. ""That must change.""
'Values I try to teach'
It wasn't just politicians who spoke up. On Tuesday, a tweet from Longoria said the actress was ""proud"" to support HERO. She included a link to a donation page for the Human Rights Campaign's Houston Equal Rights political action committee, which notes that actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, of ""Modern Family,"" and his husband would match every dollar donated up to $20,000.
""Join me in the fight,"" Longoria's tweet urged.
Actress Sally Field spoke in support of the ordinance at a news conference in Houston on Thursday. An athlete and another actor also appeared in two videos posted Friday to the Human Rights Campaign YouTube channel. ""Work hard, play hard. Football in Texas raised me with these values,"" says Michael Sam, the first openly gay NFL draftee, who grew up near Galveston. ""As part of a team, it didn't matter if you were black or white, gay or straight, we were all equals in football and in life.""
Actor Matt Bomer, a Spring native, posed an ethical argument: ""I was raised with the belief that everyone deserves to be treated equally. These are the same values I grew up with in Houston and they're the same values that I try to teach my kids.""
In addition to Apple and Hewlett-Packard, corporate support for HERO came from General Electric, BASF and EMC Corp. They joined around 60 local businesses, including Dow Chemical, backing the proposition, according to a statement posted Friday by Houston Unites, the main campaign backing the proposition's passage.
""Our stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love,"" read a statement from Apple posted by the coalition.
BASF said in the coalition's post: ""Our ability to continue to invest and grow (in Houston and the surrounding area) depends on our ability to fully leverage the advantages of a multicultural city that offers equal rights for all.""
'Every vote will count'
The dispute in America's fourth-largest city drew Friday headlines from Vice (""How Houston is Being Duped by Bigoted Zealots"") and People Magazine (""Hillary Clinton, Sally Field, Matt Bomer and More Stars Rally to Fight Anti-Transgender Discrimination"") as well as online commentary from LGBT advocacy groups.
On the ground, the local campaign described the support as a validation of its efforts.
""We've known from the very beginning that this was going to be a very close race,"" said Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, the local group supporting the ordinance. ""Every vote will count. That kind of attention and making sure people know this is coming up and on the ballot is really helpful.""
But opponents said the support, arriving in the ""last minute,"" spoke to the nature of the pro-HERO campaign.
""It's a desperate campaign resorting to desperate tactics,"" said Jared Woodfill, spokesman for Campaign for Houston. He said the celebrities were from outside the Houston area, whereas those opposing the ordinance were ""people that would have to live under the law.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,880,91.82,62.31,29.25,44,20.47,26.82,80.23,58.98,43.86,7.73,4.09,0.91,0.68,0.11,0.57,1.14,3.64,12.73,8.07,0.91,15.34,5,2.39,6.02,0.45,13.52,5.34,2.95,6.93,1.7,1.14,4.09,8.86,1.02,7.84,1.14,1.02,0.91,1.25,0.23,3.3,0,4.55,3.07,1.48,0.8,0.45,0.34,0,0.11,0,0,17.61,10.34,2.05,0,1.25,1.7,3.18,7.61,0.34,0,0.8,0.8,4.77,3.98,0.23,0.57,5,1.7,0.68,1.82,1.14,0.11,1.25,0,0,0,0,0,0.91,0,0,0.57,0,0.11,0,0.11,0,0.23,0.11,0,2.73,9.32,0.57,1.59,6.59,0.57,0.11,0.23,3.07,6.48,1.59,1.02,0.57,0.57,0,0,0,21.02,4.89,6.36,0,0,2.05,7.73,0,0.23,0,0.11,0,0.34,3.72,3.76,3.61,3.74,2.91,-2.78,-0.4,0.33,-0.76,0.02,0.34,1.59,0.45,0.45,1.59,0.45,1.02,0,0.57,0,0.11,0.23,0.8,0.11,0.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.11,0,0,2.51,1.46,16.37,295.45,2.05,397.73,0.8,68.18,0.45,181.82,1.59,68.18,-0.23,284.09,1.14,454.55,0,125,-0.23,22.73,0.23,56.82,0,125,45.45,102.27,34.09,22.73,68.18,0.45,113.64,90.91,68.18,34.09,11.36,0.11,0,90.91,22.73,125,68.18,34.09,11.36,0.45,1,0.34,1.48,0.23,0,0,0,0.23,0,0.34,0.34,0.11,0,1
11/1/15,19,A,"Why so down? Reasons abound for 2-5 Texans - QB circus, porous 'D' contribute to tailspin as midseason arrives ","Texans
vs. Titans
When/where: Noon today; NRG Stadium.
TV/radio: CBS; 610 AM; 100.3 FM, 1180 AM (Spanish).
A Texans season once brimming with promise reaches the halfway mark Sunday roiling in chaos.
The hard knocks have kept coming long after HBO's ""Hard Knocks"" cameras left town. When much of America was watching in prime time, the team was only a manufactured soap opera. Now, it's the real deal.
In just the last eight days, a quarterback missed the team flight to Miami; the coach and general manager were at odds over how fast to get rid of the irresponsible QB; the team looked so bad in falling behind 41-0 to the Miami Dolphins that a national broadcaster called the players out for ""loafing""; and the best offensive player was lost to a season-ending injury.
Even the Texans' mild-mannered owner, Bob McNair, got himself caught up in a civic controversy when he awkwardly rescinded a $10,000 donation to opponents of the proposed Houston Equal Rights Ordinance.
If it could go wrong, it has.
""I'm astonished the wheels have come off so completely so fast,"" said Spencer Tillman, a former Houston Oiler who serves as a television analyst for Texans preseason games and keeps close tabs on the team.
Loss of Foster stings
Despite the troubles, the Texans haven't played themselves out of postseason contention after five losses in seven games. A team that has fallen into 42-0 and 41-0 chasms over the last four weeks - almost unheard-of deficits in the parity-driven NFL - finds itself a single victory out of first place in the woebegone AFC South.
So hope still springs eternal in the collective heart of a beaten-down but doggedly loyal fan base that has gobbled up every ticket the 14-year-old NFL franchise has printed.
Should it?
""There's no replacing Arian Foster; that's the story everybody should be talking about,"" said Chris Myers, the recently retired Texans center. And normally, the loss of the team's star running back and most pivotal offensive player (Foster tore his Achilles tendon late in the already-lost Miami game) would be the topic du jour.
Instead, the recent focus has been on the relationship between coach Bill O'Brien and general manager Rick Smith and how they handled petulant quarterback Ryan Mallett, whose latest transgression was missing the Texans' charter flight to Florida.
O'Brien wanted Mallett cut immediately, but Smith overruled the second-year coach because the team wouldn't have had a backup for starter Brian Hoyer in last week's game. Mallett was released Tuesday, and O'Brien said his relationship with Smith remains a solid working ""partnership.""
As early as last season, when the team was doing well, O'Brien has pushed for more control in shaping the roster. But Smith, in his 10th year as GM, retains control of the draft and the support of McNair when conflicts arise.
The O'Brien-Smith tension followed McNair's own issues a few days earlier when he canceled his donation to opponents of the HERO ballot proposition.
In a written statement that quoted Robert F. Kennedy, McNair said he doesn't ""believe in or tolerate personal or professional discrimination of any kind.""
It was a sidebar distraction McNair didn't need with the Texans in such a bad state that he saw the need to make a rare locker-room visit following the debacle against the Dolphins.
While there, he was seen huddling with veteran nose tackle Vince Wilfork, who had been brought to Houston from New England to help the Texans reach a Super Bowl but has become a symbol of this season's shortcomings.
Wilfork was expected to be the glue for an emergent, J.J. Watt-led defense that, combined with Foster's running, would cancel out the Texans' apparent deficiencies at quarterback, where the repackaged journeyman Hoyer was being asked to take the reins.
Now, Foster's out of the picture, and Wilfork ...
""Vince Wilfork, (I) love him to death, but he's not the same player (he was as a Patriot),"" said Rodney Harrison, a longtime NFL strong safety, two-time All-Pro and current NBC football analyst. ""He absolutely has (had) no impact.""
Mallett 'a train wreck'
Wilfork doesn't deserve to be singled out as the culprit for the Texans' flawed techniques and listless play on defense, but he's high on the short list.
At the top of the list could be O'Brien's handling of the team's quarterback situation, both this season and last. After not being satisfied with Ryan Fitzpatrick following a 9-7 season, the Texans dropped him and signed Hoyer.
O'Brien named Hoyer the starter before the team's third preseason game, but by the fourth quarter of the opener, he had been replaced by Mallett, who would start the next four games. Mallett was benched during the Colts game Oct. 8 and was caught on national TV sulking on the sidelines.
Mallett had become a growing tumor in the locker room through his irresponsible behavior - he also missed a training-camp practice because, ostensibly, he overslept - before being released last week.
""Mallett was a train wreck from the onset,"" Tillman said. ""Even as an outsider, you could see that he was a threat to the team, the classic entitled millennial who acted like he deserved something he hadn't earned. Fixing problems on the field and off the field is about identifying threats. I can't understand how that problem was allowed to go on like it did.""
But if getting rid of Mallett solves the off-field dynamics, there's still the question of whether this team will respond to O'Brien and play well enough to win in the second half of the season. Players haven't tuned the coach out, several team members say, and Wilfork was supportive of O'Brien in his talk with McNair. However, several said privately they were surprised by the coach's quick change at quarterback from Hoyer to Mallett and back to Hoyer in the first five games.
Essential for a Texans revival will be much greater week-to-week, series-to-series consistency from Hoyer, a measure of personnel continuity in the injury-wracked offensive line (only once has the entire starting lineup remained the same in consecutive games), and night-and-day improvement in tackling and pass coverage by the linebackers and secondary. Both groups seemed disinclined to lay a firm hand on anybody last Sunday, allowing the Dolphins to score touchdowns on four plays of 50 yards or longer.
""The tackling was awful in Miami,"" said Tillman, who works college football games weekly for Fox Sports. ""Terrible angles, too, just fundamental stuff. ... I saw a clear lack of desire to go knock anybody on his watch pocket.""
Bad impression
Harrison, who played 15 years in the NFL, concurred with Tillman's assessment. He, too, noticed something more troubling than subpar foot speed and/or flawed techniques when he watched, with ""displeasure,"" the Miami game. He said the Texans looked ""completely discouraged"" to him, and that manifested itself in ""some of their key players not even hustling. One guy who I particularly love, Brian Cushing, I saw him loaf on a couple of plays. And it was surprising to me (to see) that from a guy who (is known for) his work ethic.""
Although Cushing explained away one play Harrison referred to by saying he pulled up because he thought the Dolphin he was targeting, receiver Jarvis Landry, had gone out of bounds, one wonders if the two season-wrecking knee injuries Cushing suffered in 2012 and 2013 have cost him that extra step he needs to be an elite NFL linebacker. Only Cushing or Wilfork or another badly underperforming free-agent acquisition, safety Rahim Moore, really knows what's going on inside their heads or how their bodies feel.
Tillman predicts the situation will become even more dire if the Texans veterans ""don't step up immediately and take some leadership as a point of pride.""
""They have to question their heart and their will,"" Tillman said. ""Everybody in that locker room has to look at themselves hard. I'm calling out J.J. Watt. I'm calling out Cushing. And I'm calling out the coaches. I'm calling out (defensive coordinator) Romeo Crennel. They're either coaching (badly) or they're tolerating (mistakes). Either way, it's not acceptable.""
There's still time
The Texans are fixable, insists Chester Pitts, a retired offensive lineman and an original Texan.
""It's tackling,"" Pitts said. ""They know how to tackle. What happened in Miami should never happen to an NFL team. It's on (Crennel's) shoulders to get the defense where it needs to be.""
Pitts suggested calling a ""come to Jesus"" players-only meeting or two, ""which sometimes help."" Big-picture changes aren't an option, Myers said. The Texans are far too deep into the season.
You can't throw out your offensive and defensive schemes, and you can't practice harder or longer. If anything, you have to back off. Every player is dealing with aches and pains to varying degrees.
""They've been down by 40 points twice in four weeks,"" Myers said, shaking his head. ""That's probably never happened in NFL history. So you have to be asking yourself, as a player, where are we? What's going on? There's enough talent in the room. That was a team that won nine games last year. Somehow, they've got to go back to the basics and get their heads straight.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1544,80.17,50.86,36.76,12.16,18.16,23.25,79.92,62.11,48.51,8.16,5.25,0.71,0.06,0.45,2.4,1.04,2.91,14.7,9.33,2.53,13.15,7.71,4.53,6.15,1.3,16.19,5.31,4.15,4.92,1.75,1.1,2.14,10.1,0.52,9.39,1.62,1.1,1.62,1.94,0.45,3.43,0,4.79,1.88,2.66,1.81,0.26,1.3,0.13,0.39,0.06,0,10.95,5.25,1.49,0,0.52,0.97,1.81,6.74,0,0,0,2.53,0.32,0.13,0,0.19,4.6,2.59,0.19,1.55,0.19,0.06,1.3,0.39,0.19,0,0,0,0,0.06,0.06,0.91,0.19,0.84,0.26,0.26,0,0.19,0.52,0.13,4.53,10.69,0.58,2.66,6.93,0.91,0.06,0.52,4.92,6.09,3.82,1.17,0.06,0,0.06,0,0,23.58,5.89,5.63,0.19,0,4.08,7.77,0,0.58,0,0.13,0.06,0.45,2.25,2.16,2.1,2.03,1.74,-2.18,-0.89,-0.22,-0.16,-1.58,0.19,0.39,0.39,0.39,0.13,0.06,0.58,0.06,0.32,0.13,0.13,0,0.84,0.32,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,0.06,1.6,2.13,15.38,174.87,1.3,349.74,-1.81,213.73,1.62,168.39,1.17,123.06,-0.97,304.4,-0.71,433.94,0,64.77,-0.19,6.48,0.06,6.48,0,25.91,45.34,142.49,6.48,19.43,58.29,-0.13,187.82,45.34,0,19.43,0,0,0,51.81,19.43,116.58,19.43,12.95,0,0.97,1,0.06,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,0,0.13,1

From Capitol Hill to Hollywood to Silicon Valley, a number of nationally known figures are expressing support for the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, known as HERO. Their voices emerged last week as early voting drew to an end, and a close battle over the proposition was still predicted ahead of Tuesday's vote.
Proponents have hailed the proposition as an overdue ban on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, as well as sex, race and other classifications. Opponents have characterized it as a dangerous move that would allow men dressed in women's clothing to enter women's restrooms and commit sexual assaults - actions that are banned by existing laws.
Locally, the fight has played out on living room television screens and front doorsteps, as dramatic ads aired and volunteers made calls and went knocking door to door. Mayoral candidates have debated the issue, brought forward by and passed under Mayor Annise Parker - the first openly lesbian mayor of a major American city - before a state Supreme Court decision landed it on the November ballot. Notable Texas figures such as Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, former Astros player Lance Berkman and Texans owner Bob McNair (who ultimately rescinded his financial support) already had aligned themselves against the ordinance. Last week, celebrities took to Twitter in support of the measure, using the hashtags #HERO and #YesOnProp1. The social media messages were widely shared.
""No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love - I support efforts for equality in Houston & beyond,"" Clinton tweeted Thursday, signing off with ""-H"" said to indicate she wrote it personally.
White House spokesman Jeff Tiller on Thursday said President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, though not formally endorsing the Houston measure, were ""confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality,"" according to an article by BuzzFeed. (The @VP and @POTUS accounts, however, were silent on the matter.)
A tweet from Sanders' account followed on Friday.
""In many states, it is legal to fire someone for being gay or to deny someone housing for being transgender,"" read the Sanders tweet. ""That must change.""
'Values I try to teach'
It wasn't just politicians who spoke up. On Tuesday, a tweet from Longoria said the actress was ""proud"" to support HERO. She included a link to a donation page for the Human Rights Campaign's Houston Equal Rights political action committee, which notes that actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, of ""Modern Family,"" and his husband would match every dollar donated up to $20,000.
""Join me in the fight,"" Longoria's tweet urged.
Actress Sally Field spoke in support of the ordinance at a news conference in Houston on Thursday. An athlete and another actor also appeared in two videos posted Friday to the Human Rights Campaign YouTube channel. ""Work hard, play hard. Football in Texas raised me with these values,"" says Michael Sam, the first openly gay NFL draftee, who grew up near Galveston. ""As part of a team, it didn't matter if you were black or white, gay or straight, we were all equals in football and in life.""
Actor Matt Bomer, a Spring native, posed an ethical argument: ""I was raised with the belief that everyone deserves to be treated equally. These are the same values I grew up with in Houston and they're the same values that I try to teach my kids.""
In addition to Apple and Hewlett-Packard, corporate support for HERO came from General Electric, BASF and EMC Corp. They joined around 60 local businesses, including Dow Chemical, backing the proposition, according to a statement posted Friday by Houston Unites, the main campaign backing the proposition's passage.
""Our stores and our company are open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love,"" read a statement from Apple posted by the coalition.
BASF said in the coalition's post: ""Our ability to continue to invest and grow (in Houston and the surrounding area) depends on our ability to fully leverage the advantages of a multicultural city that offers equal rights for all.""
'Every vote will count'
The dispute in America's fourth-largest city drew Friday headlines from Vice (""How Houston is Being Duped by Bigoted Zealots"") and People Magazine (""Hillary Clinton, Sally Field, Matt Bomer and More Stars Rally to Fight Anti-Transgender Discrimination"") as well as online commentary from LGBT advocacy groups.
On the ground, the local campaign described the support as a validation of its efforts.
""We've known from the very beginning that this was going to be a very close race,"" said Richard Carlbom, campaign manager for Houston Unites, the local group supporting the ordinance. ""Every vote will count. That kind of attention and making sure people know this is coming up and on the ballot is really helpful.""
But opponents said the support, arriving in the ""last minute,"" spoke to the nature of the pro-HERO campaign.
""It's a desperate campaign resorting to desperate tactics,"" said Jared Woodfill, spokesman for Campaign for Houston.

12/27/15,20,A,"How will Houston remember 2015? - Oil topped news, but headlines weren't all gloom ","When Houstonians look back on 2015, which stories will stick in our collective memory? Most likely, it'll be the turning points: When history of one sort or another was made; when the world changed underneath our feet.
These were some of those moments, some of those stories.
The oil bust cometh: In January 2015, we were freaked out that oil had fallen under $50 a barrel - way below the Goldilocks, just- right $80 a barrel that common wisdom says is good for both oil companies and the American economy. Now, in December, the price skirts the once-unthinkable $35. And there are nervous whispers it could go as low as $20.
This was the year the pain began: Energy companies cut thousands of Houston-area jobs, and housing sales and sales taxes dropped. But building cranes still dot the city's various skylines; restaurants and high-rises and parks are still opening; brave new enterprises still dare to be born.
Optimists note that Houston is a huge, hustling city, far less dependent on oil and gas than we once were, and thus able to absorb shocks to that sector. But veterans of previous busts say we've seen this eerie lag time before: It takes a good while for the energy industry's agony to radiate to other parts of the economy.
Are we still near the top of the roller coaster? Or have oil prices hit bottom already? How long will this bust last? And how bad is it going to hurt? Right now, no one can say.
The oil boom's gift to the bayous: At least Houston made good use of its last oil boom, laying groundwork for the bayou-bank parks that will be the era's lasting signature. This year, City Council approved an ambitious master plan for Memorial Park, and work began on its Eastern Glades. Bayou Greenways 2020 launched, aiming to create a continuous 150-mile network of hike-and-bike trails in five years. Count the heavily used new White Oak Bayou Path and Buffalo Bayou Park among its successes.
Ted Cruz for president: Cruz is the sworn enemy of old-school, deal-cutting Republicans, that business-friendly tribe that includes the Bushes, John Cornyn and John Boehner. But somehow, the more the junior senator from Texas alienates those Republicans, the more Republican primary voters seem to love him. In spring, when Cruz announced his candidacy, he seemed the longest of long shots. Now he's frequently described as the contender most likely to unseat Donald Trump and win the party's nomination.
Sandra Bland: In spring of 2015, #BlackLivesMatter stories began landing on the nation like drumbeats. There was Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Justus Howell in Illinois; Walter Scott in South Carolina. There was the terrible Charleston church shooting.
In July, it was Sandra Bland's name that rang out. Sandra Bland, the 28-year-old Chicago bookworm who'd just taken a job at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M. Sandra Bland, whom a state trooper stopped on University Drive for failing to signal a lane change.
Sandra Bland, whose minor traffic stop escalated fast after she expressed irritation, after she refused to put out her cigarette. Sandra Bland, whom the trooper forced out of her car, yelling that he'd Taser her, then told her to lie on the ground, arms handcuffed behind her back.
Sandra Bland, who wrote on her Waller County Jail intake form that she'd recently attempted suicide. Sandra Bland, who, left alone and unmonitored, hung herself in a jail cell.Sandra Bland, who is still in the news because the state trooper who pulled her over still faces criminal scrutiny. In a different year, her story wouldn't have been front-page news. But 2015 was not that year.
""#SayHerName,"" people tweeted. ""#SayHerName.""
LGBT wins - and a loss: By chance, this year's Pride Parade, scheduled for late June, fell close on the heels of the Supreme Court decision on same-sex marriage. For the first time, the parade wasn't in Montrose, historically Houston's gay ghetto, but downtown, in the center of Houston power. Spectators lined up right in front of City Hall, where Annise Parker, the nation's most prominent lesbian politician, was finishing her last term-limited year as mayor. On that hot Saturday, as the rainbow flags waved, the movement's battles seemed over; its war seemed won.
But by early November, Houston's LGBT universe felt entirely different. A whopping 61 percent of voters rejected the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, a Parker-supported law the broad-spectrum protection of which would have extended not just to women, racial minorities, the elderly and the handicapped - groups already protected by federal laws - but also to LGBT people, who are not.
Opponents had laser-focused on transgender bathroom rights. ""The bathroom bill,"" they called the ordinance. ""No men in women's restrooms!"" was the rallying cry. A black-and-white ad showed a threatening, plaid-shirted man entering a stall in a women's restroom, apparently with intent to rape a wide-eyed little girl - never mind that the ordinance would have legalized no such thing.
After the election, anti-HERO activists talked of taking their campaign to other cities - including Dallas, where a similar law has been on the books for 13 years. They talked of cultural conservatives at last finding their voice, of turning the tide.
It's clear that this year marks a turning point in Houston's LGBT history. But what sort of turn, exactly? Will HERO's downfall spread to other cities? Or was it an anomaly, a local exception to the broader sweep of history?
The Astros: In 2014, the Astros were a punch line: Houstonians couldn't watch their hometown team on TV, but hey, who wanted to watch those losers anyway? This year, that all changed. Not only did the Astros get a local TV contract, but they gave Houston a team worth watching. A once-upon-a-time fairytale team, people called them. They won a playoff game. They had a Rookie of the Year and Cy Young Award winner. And they did it all despite a rival team's alleged hacking into their top-secret analytics database.
How we'll get there: Slowly, as parts of the city grows denser, taller and more tightly packed, Houstonians' utter reliance on personal cars is waning. 2015 was a year of major growth - and growing pains - for other forms of transportation.
In May, Houston Metro opened two new lightrail lines. But with no money for further rail expansion, Metro shifted its attention. In August, the agency debuted a ""reimagined"" bus system - a switchup said to be the most significant operational change that any American transit system has made in the last 30 years. The bet is that more frequent, more reliable buses on heavily used routes can lure at least some of us out of our cars.
Clearly, we've already begun riding more often in other people's cars: The app-enabled ride-sharing service Uber grew explosively here this year - and it also began, reluctantly, to comply with city demands that it behave like a grown-up company and require stringent background checks of its drivers.
Bike paths and protected lanes continued to spread fast: In March, for instance, the city opened its first two-way protected bike lane, a bright green swath of downtown's Lamar Street.
The problem? As more bikers hit the roads, more cars hit bikers. In June, after a spate of cyclist deaths, bike activists called for tougher enforcement of traffic laws via a ""die-in"" in front of City Hall: For four minutes, protesters lay silently on the ground next to their bikes. ""Bike lives matter,"" said a sign.
The Blue Bell bombshell: In Texas iconography, Blue Bell ice cream stood for all that was sweet, pure and unsullied. Until April, that is.
That month, Blue Bell Creameries recalled all of its products from 23 states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, listeria-contaminated Blue Bell products had sickened at least 13 people since 2010 and were responsible for the deaths of three.
But that wasn't all. Blue Bell found strong evidence of listeria in its Broken Arrow, Okla., plant as early as 2013 but failed to improve its sanitation programs, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
And at the company's flagship plant in Brenham, former workers described sanitation failures that management systematically ignored - including, memorably, a dirty air vent that dripped steadily, day after day, onto Fudge Bombstiks.
But so what? On Aug. 31, when Blue Bell products returned to Houston grocery stores, die-hard customers lined up to buy. Some, unable to wait, opened their pints and began eating right there in the checkout line.
Blue Bell remains an icon. But it doesn't stand for purity anymore. Now it stands for Texans' stubborn loyalty.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1433,86.82,56.29,53.72,21.07,16.47,22.12,79.55,56.8,44.24,8.23,3.63,0,0.7,0,1.33,0.91,4.61,16.05,8.03,2.09,13.19,4.82,3.7,5.3,0.98,10.47,7.26,4.19,5.65,1.61,1.54,2.65,8.3,0.7,7.54,1.19,1.47,0.56,1.47,0.28,3,0.21,3.98,2.02,1.95,1.19,0.35,0.84,0.14,0.07,0.07,0,9.77,3.63,0.42,0,0.7,0.21,1.81,6,0.07,0,1.33,0.49,2.37,1.61,0.21,0.56,3.28,0.35,0.21,1.95,0.84,0.07,2.16,0.42,0.21,0,0.07,0.07,0.49,0.56,0.28,0.07,0.07,0.35,0,0,0,0.42,0.77,0.07,5.23,12.21,0.49,1.61,8.51,1.33,0.35,0.56,6.21,6.21,2.09,0.7,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,22.47,5.51,7.47,0.77,0.07,2.44,6.21,0,0.28,0,0.14,0,0.21,3.02,2.77,2.66,2.69,2.28,-2.72,-1.76,-0.89,-1.47,-1.77,0.35,0.21,0.07,0.49,0.49,0,0.84,0.07,0.63,0.07,0.42,0.21,0.49,0.28,0.28,0,0.07,0.14,0,0,0.07,0,0,0,2.3,2.32,15.48,118.63,0.63,307.05,-0.42,174.46,0.98,188.42,1.26,125.61,-0.98,286.11,0.07,321,0,139.57,0,6.98,0.07,20.94,0,55.83,111.65,223.31,27.91,27.91,132.59,0,132.59,55.83,6.98,27.91,6.98,0.07,48.85,83.74,34.89,76.76,41.87,27.91,6.98,0.77,1,0.14,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0.07,0,1

12/24/15,20,News,The Worst Local Policy Proposals of 2015 ,"
Running a city ain't easy, but that can't excuse some of the ideas put forth by local leaders around the U.S. this year. We've rounded up the most bizarre and egregious contenders covered by CityLab in 2015, listed here in chronological order. They range from rear- guard actions against urbanist improvements to self-serving NIMBY ploys to eerily fascist displays of force. Here's hoping nobody calls for bringing back any of these truly terrible ideas in 2016.
January: Gainesville backtracks on better streets The new year kicked off with this Florida city undoing a road diet that had converted a four-lane road into two car lanes and two bike lanes. The redesign coincided with an eightfold jump in cyclists using the road and a decrease in injuries and damage from car crashes. With limited data it's hard to say for sure that the road diet was the cause of those improvements, but there's good reason to believe it was. In any case, occasional bottlenecks where the road narrowed down to two lanes spurred a backlash and prompted the mayor to decry ‚Äúroad diet ideology‚Äù in an editorial. The city sent in a paint crew to reinstate the road's old car-first approach.
April: Los Angeles aggressively tickets pedestrians The LAPD went on a pedestrian ticketing spree in late April, targeting high-foot- traffic crosswalks near Metro stations and slapping $197 fines on anyone who stepped into the street after the red hand started flashing. (The city council responded by asking the LAPD to justify the action and by examining the law behind the tickets.) As L.A. ramps up its effort to convert from a car-oriented city to a more walkable one, obsessively fining pedestrians for, well, walking is as counterintuitive as it gets.
May: Chicago offers up historic parkland for a presidential center President Obama has deep ties to Chicago, so it's not surprising he'd want his presidential library to be built there. What is surprising, though, is the manner in which his foundation and its academic partner, the University of Chicago, proposed to build it: by seizing 20 acres of historic, Frederick Law Olmsted-designed public parkland. Mayor Rahm Emanuel easily shepherded a bill through the state legislature to enable just that. The move means that, instead of looking at 100 or so acres of vacant land in the vicinity of the parks under consideration, the presidential library will be taking away common land that the public has enjoyed for decades. Nothing grassroots about that.
June: L.A. contemplates a war on the homeless (Reuters / Lucy Nicholson) In June, the Los Angeles city council passed an ordinance to encourage the seizure of homeless people's property stored on sidewalks or in parks within 24 hours of a warning- including medications and personal documents. Mayor Eric Garcetti let the policy become law without his signature but said he didn't want it to be enforced until some amendments were added. The bill drew support from homeowners who would like to see the city's sizable homeless population (currently estimated at 25,000) cleaned up and removed, but it's the city's job to balance clean streets with human welfare. Confiscating the few items left to someone who's lost everything ensures the problem of homelessness won't go away any time soon.
August: New York targets the Times Square pedestrian zone The Bloomberg administration managed to change New York's Times Square from a congested intersection with limited sidewalk space into a roomy pedestrian plaza with tables, chairs, and space to live your life. The transformation received rave reviews, people flocked to it, and pedestrian injuries dropped 35 percent. Yet all that progress was no match for a few painted nipples. The success of the plaza attracted a rambunctious assortment of street
performers including desnudas, women who don body paint and little else to pose for photos and earn tips from tourists. Rather than constructively address concerns about the topless women, Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested removing the plaza altogether, reminding the world that even successful, widely praised city innovations aren't safe.
September: Coronado, California, votes to suspend new bicycle lanes because they ... look bad ( K.G.Hawes / Flickr) The seaside town of Coronado was trying to decide whether or not to add 12 additional miles of bike routes. But that simple expansion-shown to decrease travel times, increase traffic for businesses, and generally make the streets safer for everybody-ran into a firestorm of befuddling opposition. Residents lambasted the new bike lanes as ‚Äúgraffiti on the streets‚Äù and ‚Äúa visual cacophony that if you look there long enough it will induce a dizzying type of vertigo.‚Äù One citizen of Coronado took the grand prize for hyperbole: ‚ÄúIt's very  similar to personally taking all three of my daughters to a tattoo parlor and having them completely body tattooed.‚Äù The mayor and city council evidently found these arguments persuasive.
October: Charlotte police propose exclusion zones for anyone who's been arrested there The Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police asked for the power to designate ‚Äúpublic safety zones‚Äù that would allow them to legally bar anyone arrested there from reentering later. Of course, not everyone arrested for a crime is charged or found guilty of it, meaning people who don't actually do anything wrong could be kicked out of whole swaths of the city. On top of that, the police department has a well-documented history of searching and arresting black men at higher rates than white men. As our own Kriston Capps described the ill-conceived policy (which has since, thankfully, been abandoned):
‚ÄúPublic safety zones‚Äù would return Charlotte to de jure segregation. Or at least, to a standard whereby white authorities could decide where black citizens can and cannot congregate.
October: A Boulder, Colorado, ballot initiative puts zoning in the hands of NIMBYs Cities have to balance many complicated values when deciding on housing density. There are homeowners who made an investment they'd like to see grow, but there are also the concerns of the future city, where new residents will need places to live, too. Boulder's ballot initiative No. 300 would have pulled zoning discussions from the citywide level down to the neighborhood level, with disastrous effects. Previously, the public could challenge zoning decisions with a petition signed by 10 percent of the electorate. This measure would have divided the city into 66 neighborhoods, each of which could challenge and vote on a zoning decision affecting that neighborhood. ‚ÄúThis is mega-NIMBYism at work,‚Äù wrote CityLab's Kriston Capps, allowing any given part of town to reject any new housing. Voters rejected the proposal in November. November: Houston voters equate equal rights with men in women's bathrooms (Pat Sullivan / AP) Houston's city council had passed a proposal that would have protected residents from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, among many other characteristics. But then a Texas court ruled that it needed to go before voters. A group called the Campaign for Houston ran a media blitz suggesting that male sexual predators, posing as transgender men, might exploit the anti- discrimination measure to follow women or girls into the bathroom and do terrible things. Of course, such a crime is against the law with or without an equal rights ordinance. But the fact-blurring campaign succeeded in selling its message- vote ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to keep men out of women's bathrooms-and won the day, 61 percent to 39.
November: Roanoke likens Syrian refugees to Japanese-Americans interned in World War II All those Syrian refugees who had planned to cross an ocean and find a new life in Roanoke, Virginia, suffered a rude awakening when Mayor David Bowers called on his city to ‚Äúsuspend and delay‚Äù any help for refugees until the war in Syria ends. Moreover, he said the threat from ISIS was just as grave as that which drove the U.S. to ‚Äúsequester Japanese foreign nationals‚Äù after Pearl Harbor. Where to begin with this idea. First off, it conflates the civilians fleeing civil war in Syria with the combatants of ISIS. It then holds up as praiseworthy the Japanese internment program, which is widely recognized as a black mark on American history (and for which Congress officially apologized with hundreds of millions of dollars in reparations). Bowers later apologized, saying, ‚ÄúIt's not in my heart to be racist or bigoted.‚Äù",Campaign for Houston ,1,1373,93.98,44.81,48.53,25.9,23.67,27.31,80.92,58.41,45.3,6.41,1.89,0.15,0.15,0.15,0.51,0.36,4.52,14.2,8.81,1.82,16.39,5.17,3.35,5.17,1.17,11.65,5.9,3.71,6.19,0.66,1.6,4.01,11.07,0.8,10.27,1.68,1.53,1.75,1.97,0.58,3.5,0.07,5.39,2.84,2.4,1.38,0.58,0.66,0.07,0.22,0.07,0,10.34,4.08,0.66,0.15,0.87,0.29,1.46,5.32,0.07,0,0.51,1.09,3.86,2.91,0.73,0.22,2.48,0,0.73,1.53,0.36,0,1.6,0.73,0.15,0.22,0,0,0.15,0,0.07,0.29,0.22,0.51,0.36,0.07,0,0.51,0.58,0.15,3.42,12.16,0.58,1.89,8.89,0.87,0.07,0.15,4.08,4.3,2.4,1.17,0.15,0.15,0.07,0,0,16.61,4.95,4.3,0,0,2.04,5.32,0,0.44,0,0.07,0.15,0.15,3.43,3.2,2.93,3.2,2.73,-3.78,-2.5,-1.39,-2.16,-3.01,0.58,0.15,0.29,0.22,0.73,0.44,0.44,0,1.09,0,0.29,0.15,0.44,0.36,0.15,0,0,0,0,0,0.07,0.07,0,0,1.6,1.49,15.49,116.62,0.8,255.1,-0.8,153.06,1.09,153.06,0.73,72.89,-0.36,211.37,-0.22,276.97,0,174.93,-0.58,14.58,0.15,14.58,0,80.17,196.79,72.89,7.29,21.87,153.06,0.15,109.33,94.75,43.73,43.73,0,0,0,72.89,58.31,72.89,21.87,29.15,0,1.09,1,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0.14,0,0.14,0,0.07,0.22,1
12/19/15,20,News,GUEST COLUMN - Atlanta a transgender leader ,"As I watched the downfall of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) recently, it became obvious most people in Houston think it's acceptable to discriminate against the transgender population, which already faces monumental daily challenges in access to health care, employment, housing, public accommodations and public services. I was appalled but not surprised by how opponents vilified transgender people and spread lies about our humanity to defeat the ordinance at the ballot box.
HERO, passed by the City Council, protected Houstonians from discrimination based on many characteristics, including race, age, religion, military status and others. It prohibited bias in employment, housing, public accommodations and city services. But opponents, who sued to get the ordinance on the ballot, made it strictly about bathroom access for transgender people, painting trans people as predators and ignoring reason and facts. This effort succeeded, as it has many times in the past.
The falsity of these arguments against equality are clearly shown by the experience of modern Sun Belt cities like Atlanta. Atlanta is in the vanguard of cities protecting transgender people. In 2009, the U.S. District Court here ruled that Vandy Beth Glenn could bring a claim of discrimination after being fired from her legislative editing job at the Georgia General Assembly for being transgender; the ruling was later approved by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. The Glenn v. Brumby decision was one of the first appeals court rulings to protect transgender people from sex discrimination under federal law.
Atlanta itself amended its municipal code in 2013 to include gender identity in all its non-discrimination ordinances. The dire, over- the-top consequences prophesied by the Houston opponents of equality, about transgender people coming into bathrooms to wreak havoc, have not come to pass in Atlanta. In fact, Atlanta is more prosperous than ever, with rising wages, falling unemployment, low property taxes and the third-highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies in the U.S.
Houston, by contrast, is experiencing challenging economic conditions. Atlanta's tolerance of diversity predicts its increasing success, as business theorists like Richard Florida teach, because the creative class attracted by tolerance is a necessary precondition for 21st-century success.
As an attorney who fights against discrimination in transgender employment and health care in federal courts around the country, including Georgia, I recently argued the case of Chavez v. Credit Nation Auto Sales before the 11th Circuit. The case involves a Georgia auto mechanic allegedly harassed on the job and ultimately fired for being transgender. There was not a single question from the bench about whether transgender people are deserving of protection from sex discrimination, as both sides and the judges understood the legal proposition that transgender people are protected from sex discrimination is now well established here.
Having handled about 30 such cases all over the U.S. in the past several years, I can say with confidence that the dire consequences predicted by the Houston opponents of equality have not come to pass in any U.S. jurisdiction. Likewise, Atlanta's embrace of diversity has created success, not problems.
We are at a time in our civil rights movement when many still doubt the essential humanity of trans people, regarding us as mentally disordered sexual predators. We are clearly not that, but if prejudice could be dispelled by reason and facts, there would be no need for civil rights law. Atlanta embraced equality, including transgender equality, with open arms, and it is prospering; while Houston, effectively bamboozled by the loudest, meanest, most deceptive voices, is experiencing challenging times.
Sun Belt cities would do well to look to Atlanta for lessons on tolerance and prosperity and the link between the two.

12/15/15,20,B,City Hall - Old and new members all must confront the challenges that lie ahead. ,"Sylvester Turner may have won the runoff race for mayor, but he came in second on Saturday in the contest for top vote-getter. That award went to Amanda Edwards, the new council member in the At-Large 4 seat. While two established figures went head-to-head at the top of the ballot, the 33-year-old attorney was able to cut through the partisan rhetoric and garner more support than anyone else with her positive, forward-looking vision for Houston. After such a divisive election, perhaps it is a sign that Houstonians are ready to once again unite and work to make our city even better.
But City Hall won't have the luxury of focusing on new and interesting ideas unless our elected officials tackle Houston's core problems: infrastructure, the budget and, above all, pensions.
The new city controller, Chris Brown, has his work cut out for him. After six years of a quiet chief financial officer, we're ready for a bold voice to take up the fiscal bullhorn.
Change also came to District F, which elected its third council member in as many election cycles. The diverse west Houston district, which covers much of the city's Asian community, replaced first-term Councilman Richard Nguyen with Steve Le. This switch comes only two years after Nguyen replaced Al Hoang.
It will be sad to see that political neophyte leave City Hall so soon, but Nguyen made his mark with a heartfelt speech in support of the Houston equal rights ordinance during that rancorous debate.
Other newcomers include Mike Knox in At-Large 1 and Karla Cisneros in District H, an L-shaped district that covers Near Northside and Woodland Heights, and the townhouse rows of the East End.
Knox, a former police officer, proved himself particularly knowledgeable on the campaign trail and should have no trouble coming up to speed on the issues at City Hall.
Cisneros, who served on the HISD board of education from 2000 to 2006, ran an impressive door-to-door campaign. We look forward to hearing more of her ideas on addressing the opportunity gap between Houston's wealthy and poor neighborhoods.

12/14/15,20,National,California's Privacy for All 'bathroom bill' challenged with Personal Privacy Protection Act ,"
SACRAMENTO ‚Äî Give voters a chance and they will overturn California's landmark coed bathroom law in November, conservatives say ‚Äî just as voters in Houston did last month with an ordinance requiring transgender restroom access.
The challenge facing California's Privacy for All is getting its proposed initiative on the ballot next year.
Organizers made a final push last week to reach their goal of 500,000 petition signatures, due Dec. 21, for legislation that would require people to use public facilities in government buildings that correspond with their biological sex.
Certainly, the group is hoping to avoid a repeat of last year. The effort fell short when California's secretary of state threw out more than 131,000 of the 620,000 signatures the group had gathered to place the issue on the November 2014 ballot.
""If we don't get 500,000, it's an announcement that really people don't care, it's just a bunch of right-wingers who are making it a big deal. That's the way it will be shown,"" Dennis Prager, a nationally syndicated conservative radio host based in Los Angeles, said on his show last week. ""So there's a lot at stake here.""
On the other hand, ""if it does go on the ballot, of course it will pass. The vast majority of people think it's an absurdity, and it has nothing to do with being an anti-transgendered person,"" Mr. Prager said. ""It's solely common sense.""
As proposed, the Personal Privacy Protection Act would invalidate large swaths of Assembly Bill 1266, the landmark state law enacted in 2013 that requires public schools to allow bathroom, locker room and sports team access based on gender identity.
Since the bill was signed, ""it's been difficult,"" said Privacy for All spokeswoman Karen England.
""We're hearing stories, but again, the parents and school districts feel their hands are tied,"" she said. ""We have biological girls accessing boys' locker room facilities. We have teachers who are complaining. It puts them in an uncomfortable spot and sometimes in an unsafe situation. So there's a lot of concern.""
Transgender rights are widely viewed as the next frontier in the gay rights movement, which has moved to build on its success with same-sex marriage. But Ms. England said the marriage debate has little in common with whether to allow biological males access to women's restrooms and showers.
""The progressives like to tie it to gay marriage, but it's a very different issue,"" said Ms. England. ""This is not 'live and let live.' This crosses over into invading the privacy of other people. I don't know where in society it's OK for somebody of the opposite gender to expose themselves.""
California gay rights groups already are girding for a ballot fight.
After the Nov. 3 defeat of the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, which would have imposed criminal penalties and fines for anyone trying to deny access to bathrooms and locker rooms based on gender identity, Equality California warned that the Golden State would be next.
""We fully expect our opponents to use the same misinformation and scare tactics in California that they used in Houston,"" Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, said in a statement. ""Since they can no longer stop same-sex couples from getting married, this is the next page in their attempts to discriminate against the LGBT community. That's why this is an attack on both transgender people and the LGBT community as a whole."" Lower threshold for signatures
After coming up short last year, the privacy group sued, claiming county clerks threw out many signatures that were valid.
If privacy advocates win in court, they could wind up seeing the repeal initiative qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
If not, the odds of making the ballot next year with the new proposal are much improved, thanks to California's low voter turnout in 2014. The number of required signatures fell from 540,760 in 2014 to 365,880 for 2016.
Privacy for All isn't the only group taking advantage of the lower threshold. Petition campaigns are underway on a host issues, such as legalizing recreational marijuana for adults, establishing a statewide utility and overturning the state Legislature's newly tightened vaccination requirements.
In Houston, national gay rights groups such as the Human Rights Campaign lost despite outspending foes of transgender bathroom access. The Campaign for Houston's trump card was ads raising the specter of male sex offenders, who need not prove that they are transgender, attacking girls in public restrooms.
Houston Unites, which backed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, said the ads were ""bold-faced lies"" because biological males who identify as females are not in fact men.
Some businesses, universities and jurisdictions have tried to reach a compromise by offering gender-neutral restrooms, but the American Civil Liberties Union and others have argued that the option is unconstitutional because it creates a ""separate but equal"" situation.
'Reasonable accommodation'
In Virginia, the ACLU filed a lawsuit last year on behalf of Gloucester High School student Gavin Grimm, who was instructed to use a unisex restroom instead of the boys' room. Gavin is a biological female who identifies as male.
""The policy effectively expels trans students from communal restrooms and requires them to use 'alternative private' restroom facilities,"" the ACLU said in a statement, adding that the school board policy ""segregates transgender students from their peers.""
A big risk for California conservatives is that they may win at the ballot box, as they did in 2008 with the Proposition 8 initiative against same-sex marriage, but lose in the long run if the Democratic attorney general refuses to defend their initiative in court, as Jerry Brown did in his position as state attorney general.
Privacy for All has anticipated that problem by including language in the proposal saying that ""initiative proponents shall have the right to act as the agent of California for purposes of any necessary defense of this Act against legal challenge.""
The proposal includes fines of more than $4,000 for government entities or individuals found in violation. Such claims may be filed by people ""whose privacy was actually violated while using facilities or who did not use facilities because of a violation under the Act,"" according to the ballot language.
An estimated 200 jurisdictions and 17 states have laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity, but most of those are focused on preventing bias in hiring, housing and public accommodations, not expanding access to bathrooms and locker rooms.
In many cases, ""they just say you have to give a reasonable accommodation,"" Ms. England said. ""Or offer a family restroom. Kohl's has had family restrooms for years. You can access that. And if I were to enter that, if there are multiple stalls, I wouldn't expect privacy. I would know what I'm walking into. But if I walk into a girls' restroom, I don't want to be exposed to a male.""
If the California measure qualifies for the ballot, it's likely supporters of transgender restroom access will be joined by the business community, which increasingly has sided with gay rights advocates.
Even so, Ms. England says she likes the proposed initiative's odds. ""We're always outspent on family values issues,"" she said. ""But we believe the burden falls on the other side to explain why it's OK to have opposite genders in these private facilities. So we believe our position is common sense and the majority of California voters will agree with us.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,1226,85.77,63.71,29.62,18.31,20.1,25.45,81.73,59.05,45.68,8.24,4.08,0.57,0.9,0.16,0.41,1.39,4.16,13.13,8.32,1.63,14.27,7.75,2.28,5.63,1.14,14.68,5.63,3.59,7.01,2.04,1.79,3.26,11.58,0.73,10.6,1.22,2.2,1.06,1.88,0.57,4.65,0,2.45,1.14,1.31,0.41,0.08,0.33,0.08,0.16,0,0,14.19,5.87,0.24,0.49,0.9,0.49,1.96,9.3,0.49,0,1.14,1.06,2.77,2.69,0.08,0,3.59,0.16,0.57,2.69,0.33,0,1.79,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.08,0.73,0,0,0.82,0.16,0.41,0.16,0.08,0.16,0.41,0.65,0.08,3.83,7.83,0.16,1.47,5.95,0.33,0.08,0.24,2.77,3.67,4.57,1.63,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,18.52,5.38,5.79,0,0,3.26,4.08,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.08,3.82,4.05,3.34,3.59,3.17,-2.56,-1.21,-0.34,-0.43,-0.98,0.24,0.16,0.08,0.16,1.31,0.49,1.06,0,0.08,0.08,0.41,0,1.31,0.24,0.16,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,1.85,1.4,15.59,114.19,0.65,301.79,-0.49,203.92,1.55,154.98,1.47,89.72,-0.73,269.17,-0.16,252.85,0,57.1,0,16.31,0.16,24.47,0,48.94,73.41,138.66,81.57,32.63,97.88,0.49,89.72,179.45,8.16,8.16,0,0,0,122.35,16.31,97.88,146.82,16.31,24.47,1.06,1,0.08,0.49,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.41,0.65,0,1

If privacy advocates win in court, they could wind up seeing the repeal initiative qualify for the November 2016 ballot.
If not, the odds of making the ballot next year with the new proposal are much improved, thanks to California's low voter turnout in 2014. The number of required signatures fell from 540,760 in 2014 to 365,880 for 2016.
Privacy for All isn't the only group taking advantage of the lower threshold. Petition campaigns are underway on a host issues, such as legalizing recreational marijuana for adults, establishing a statewide utility and overturning the state Legislature's newly tightened vaccination requirements.
In Houston, national gay rights groups such as the Human Rights Campaign lost despite outspending foes of transgender bathroom access. The Campaign for Houston's trump card was ads raising the specter of male sex offenders, who need not prove that they are transgender, attacking girls in public restrooms.
Houston Unites, which backed the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, said the ads were ""bold-faced lies"" because biological males who identify as females are not in fact men.
Some businesses, universities and jurisdictions have tried to reach a compromise by offering gender-neutral restrooms, but the American Civil Liberties Union and others have argued that the option is unconstitutional because it creates a ""separate but equal"" situation.
'Reasonable accommodation'
In Virginia, the ACLU filed a lawsuit last year on behalf of Gloucester High School student Gavin Grimm, who was instructed to use a unisex restroom instead of the boys' room. Gavin is a biological female who identifies as male.
""The policy effectively expels trans students from communal restrooms and requires them to use 'alternative private' restroom facilities,"" the ACLU said in a statement, adding that the school board policy ""segregates transgender students from their peers.""
A big risk for California conservatives is that they may win at the ballot box, as they did in 2008 with the Proposition 8 initiative against same-sex marriage, but lose in the long run if the Democratic attorney general refuses to defend their initiative in court, as Jerry Brown did in his position as state attorney general.
Privacy for All has anticipated that problem by including language in the proposal saying that ""initiative proponents shall have the right to act as the agent of California for purposes of any necessary defense of this Act against legal challenge.""
The proposal includes fines of more than $4,000 for government entities or individuals found in violation. Such claims may be filed by people ""whose privacy was actually violated while using facilities or who did not use facilities because of a violation under the Act,"" according to the ballot language.
An estimated 200 jurisdictions and 17 states have laws prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity, but most of those are focused on preventing bias in hiring, housing and public accommodations, not expanding access to bathrooms and locker rooms.
In many cases, ""they just say you have to give a reasonable accommodation,"" Ms. England said. ""Or offer a family restroom. Kohl's has had family restrooms for years. You can access that. And if I were to enter that, if there are multiple stalls, I wouldn't expect privacy. I would know what I'm walking into. But if I walk into a girls' restroom, I don't want to be exposed to a male.""
If the California measure qualifies for the ballot, it's likely supporters of transgender restroom access will be joined by the business community, which increasingly has sided with gay rights advocates.
Even so, Ms. England says she likes the proposed initiative's odds.""We're always outspent on family values issues,"" she said. ""But we believe the burden falls on the other side to explain why it's OK to have opposite genders in these private facilities. So we believe our position is common sense and the majority of California voters will agree with us.""",Campaign for Houston ,1,1226,85.77,63.71,29.62,18.31,20.43,25.45,81.73,59.05,45.68,8.24,4.08,0.57,0.9,0.16,0.41,1.39,4.16,13.13,8.32,1.63,14.27,7.75,2.28,5.63,1.14,14.68,5.63,3.59,7.01,2.04,1.79,3.26,11.58,0.73,10.6,1.22,2.2,1.06,1.88,0.57,4.65,0,2.45,1.14,1.31,0.41,0.08,0.33,0.08,0.16,0,0,14.19,5.87,0.24,0.49,0.9,0.49,1.96,9.3,0.49,0,1.14,1.06,2.77,2.69,0.08,0,3.59,0.16,0.57,2.69,0.33,0,1.79,0.08,0.08,0,0,0.08,0.73,0,0,0.82,0.16,0.41,0.16,0.08,0.16,0.41,0.65,0.08,3.83,7.83,0.16,1.47,5.95,0.33,0.08,0.24,2.77,3.67,4.57,1.63,0.24,0,0.24,0,0,18.52,5.38,5.79,0,0,3.26,4.08,0,0.24,0,0,0,0.08,3.82,4.05,3.34,3.59,3.17,-2.56,-1.21,-0.34,-0.43,-0.98,0.24,0.16,0.08,0.16,1.31,0.49,1.06,0,0.08,0.08,0.41,0,1.31,0.24,0.16,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0,0,0,1.85,1.4,15.59,114.19,0.65,301.79,-0.49,203.92,1.55,154.98,1.47,89.72,-0.73,269.17,-0.16,252.85,0,57.1,0,16.31,0.16,24.47,0,48.94,73.41,138.66,81.57,32.63,97.88,0.49,89.72,179.45,8.16,8.16,0,0,0,122.35,16.31,97.88,146.82,16.31,24.47,1.06,1,0.08,0.49,0.16,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0.41,0.65,0,1

12/13/15,20,A,More families fighting for transgender rights ,"The kindergarten teacher handed Marissa a pink folder, the same as the other girls got.
But Marissa longed for a blue folder. The pink one seemed as wrong as the flowered clothes in which her mom dressed her, the shoulder-length hair her dad put in pigtails and even the name by which her parents called her.
When Marissa asked the teacher for a folder like the boys had, the teacher refused.
It would be a year before Marissa legally became a boy named Benjamin, who wears boxers and likes his hair cut short.
""I didn't want to be called by my girl's name, Marissa, because I didn't feel like a girl,"" recalled Ben, now 10 and in fourth grade.
One month after voters in Houston rejected an equal rights ordinance that proponents say would have protected transgender people from discrimination, Ben and his parents, Ann and Jim Elder of Friendswood, are among families nationwide challenging their communities to respect the identities of kids who feel their true gender doesn't match their bodies. Their experience, and Houston's, illustrate the gap in understanding gender identity issues and the divide over how best to deal with them in places such as public restrooms, courthouses, day care centers and schools. As much as the country has changed in accepting gay marriage, transgender rights remains a new frontier, rife with uncertainty.
Mara Keisling, director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said she expects to see a tipping point as more transgender children like Ben express themselves, just as gay rights gained momentum after families began supporting openly gay children.
Differing policies
Until then, misunderstanding reigns.
Take the case of two former Katy child care workers. A week after the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance was defeated following the airing of TV ads alleging the law would permit transgender men to assault girls in women's bathrooms, the workers said they were fired by the Katy center for refusing to treat one of their students as a transgender boy.
Accepting the child's assertion at such a young age ""just didn't make sense to me,"" said one of the workers, Madeline Kirksey, who argues that she had the child's best interests at heart. Kirksey has filed a federal discrimination complaint challenging her dismissal and is represented by an attorney who fought to bring HERO before voters, leading to its ultimate defeat.
""I still believe that, at that age, they're exploring,"" Kirksey maintained. ""It's innocence. ... Let her explore for herself until she gets older and then decide.""
Meanwhile, the Texas Association of School Boards describes transgender issues as ""relatively new in public discourse, understanding and the law.""
While state law does not explicitly protect students who are transgender, it says students are safe from discrimination ""based on their gender identity and their free speech expressions of that gender identity,"" including choice of clothing, name and gender, according to a written explanation from the association's legal division.
The association provides sample policy documents to protect against discrimination based on gender. Districts like Houston ISD have taken the language further, to explicitly cover ""gender identity and/or gender expression."" Conflict in the state regarding bathrooms and locker rooms, however, ""is not legally settled,"" the explanation reads, concluding that schools should ""assess each situation as it comes ... to reach a resolution that protects the learning environment for all.""
Early realization
Almost every day, it seems, families of gender variant kids are ""talking about their journey to understand and learn and support the child,"" says Ellen Kahn of the Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign Foundation. She traces the increased visibility to a revelatory Barbara Walters interview with a transgender girl, Jazz, now a teenage representative for the cause.
Like Ben, the children feel they don't align completely - or at all - with the gender they're assigned based on anatomy. It's a realization faced long before they hit puberty, much less before they face a choice about hormone therapy or sexual reassignment surgery. They ask others to support a social transition, from accepting a name change and how they dress to allowing them to choose where they go when boys and girls are split up for recess.
It's a cause that parents such as the Elders, who supported Ben's transition, see as inherent to the protection of livelihood: Kids in environments that don't support their gender expression are more likely to be depressed and anxious and commit suicide, according to experts.
The Elders' Christmas card in 2006 showed a smiling Marissa around age 1, clad in a pink dress and matching headband. Marissa had come into the family as a foster child. ""We hope to adopt her in the coming year,"" the card reads.
But the Elders would come to question their choice of pronouns and outfits for the child they had prayed God would send them.
Around age 4, Marissa began asking for boyish haircuts. She assumed teenage male identities when playing make-believe. In dreams, she imagined herself as a boy.
Once, as the mother and child like to tell it, Marissa picked out makeup at a department store. At home, she smeared it across her cheeks like war paint and paraded around the house as a viking, sword and shield in hand.
As young as age 3
Marni Axelrad, a pediatric psychologist at Texas Children's Hospital, told Ann Elder that Marissa was gender variant at age 6. As the mother recalls it, the doctor instructed the parents to indulge their child as ""him."" If it's a phase, it will go away, she warned them. But there was another possible outcome.
""She said that if it seems to get even stronger, and he really relishes in having a boy identity, then you have a transgender child,"" Elder recalled. ""And that's exactly what happened.""
While the medical community doesn't have clear data on why individuals identify with a certain gender, kids as young as age 3 may begin to understand ""what their preferred gender roles are, what their gender expression will be,"" said Robert McLaughlin, a clinical psychologist and dean of the school of allied health sciences at Baylor College of Medicine.
Early on, features that may indicate gender dysphoria can manifest in a preference for the clothes, toys, games or even peers of the other gender, said Meredith Chapman, a psychiatrist with Children's Health in Dallas. In more severe cases, children might say they wish to be the other gender, express unhappiness about their body or try to harm their genitals.
There isn't a clinical consensus on specific treatment methods for gender variant kids, Chapman said. But experts agree that denying a child's claims or trying to coerce him or her to be one way or another likely has dangerous ramifications.
""We never know a child's outcome,"" McLaughlin said. ""All we know is the child we have before us. We can make that child's path miserable and tragic, or we can make that child's path supported and affirmative.""
The day care in Katy where Kirksey worked is a private and independently owned franchise of Children's Lighthouse Learning Centers.
""It is the policy of Children's Lighthouse not to discriminate in any way,"" spokesman Jamie Izaks wrote in an email. ""We understand and are sensitive to the many scenarios that can arise when educating young children.""
Teachers are trained according to recommended state guidelines, including standards for confidentiality, Izaks wrote. But Kirksey suggested teachers would have benefited from a physician's explanation of transgender issues.
""We don't understand it,"" Kirksey said, explaining that school administrators simply handed staff a printout about transgender kids. ""We need to be educated more on what's going on and what's happening.""
After news of the firing got out, some critics alleged that the parents' indulgence of their child's gender preference was doing permanent damage.
""This is a test case,"" said Kirksey's attorney, Andy Taylor. ""And this will be looked at nationwide on how best do we deal with these issues.""
Other parents have tried different approaches.
On the advice of a preschool official, the parents of a Houston child, who was born a boy, took away girl toys and feminine clothes. They thought he should spend less time with Mom and more time with Dad.
The now 14-year-old, who identifies as a girl, still remembers the Swan Lake Barbie she got one Christmas that later disappeared. Thieves took the toy, her parents told her.
Having her parents come around to support her has been instrumental. Now in high school, few of her friends know about her past. She deals with anxiety and depression. But her challenges have become something she appreciates as building her character and empathy.
""I'm not just gliding through life,"" the daughter said. ""I've got obstacles.""
Crimson Jordan, 19, says his family continues to deny convictions that he is male, not female. They refused to help him learn to drive unless he wore skirts. He no longer lives with them and describes himself as ""incredibly estranged.""
""You can't choose to be this way,"" he said. ""It was crushing - soul-crushing."" Finding role models
As for the Elders, they meet monthly with a group of other families of transgender kids. Ann Elder has told parents of Ben's closest friends that he is transgender and has worked with the school administrators to arrange for his days to go smoothly.
Every day after school, Ann walks past a pastel-pink, white-and-blue striped transgender pride flag that waves in front of her home as she heads out the front door and down the street to meet Ben at the bus stop. She passes the house of neighbors whom she's reprimanded for shaming her child.
""So this is Ben,"" she says after collecting him one day. ""The love of our lives.""
Today, Ben's life sounds like that of any other elementary school kid. He makes up whimsical songs with his friends in recess. His room is filled with Legos. When asked what he did at school that day, his answer is simply: math.
Ben doesn't quite understand still why the teacher wouldn't give him the blue folder that day. Or why his biological great-grandfather - who, as it happens, dressed sometimes as a woman - was buried in a men's suit a few years ago with no mention of his transgender alias. And yet, a framed photo on Ben's wall shows three smiling men - transgender adults who serve as his role models and meet with him a few times a year. Another image shows him and his mother posing with President Barack Obama, whom he met this summer at an LGBT equality event.

12/9/15,20,b,Councilmen blast HERO-related records request ,"Councilmen Michael Kubosh and Dave Martin on Tuesday blasted a records request from a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit to those council members, who last year voted against the Houston equal rights ordinance, known as HERO.
The Campaign for Accountability's request seeks communication between prominent local anti-HERO activists as well as anti-LGBT groups, such as the Alliance Defending Freedom and the Family Research Council, and the six council members who voted against the law.
Kubosh and Martin were joined by Councilwoman Brenda Stardig and councilmen Jack Christie, Dwight Boykins and Oliver Pennington in opposing the law in May 2014.
After lengthy legal proceedings, the ordinance was placed on the ballot, and voters overwhelmingly in November opted to repeal the law. The ordinance would have extended anti-discrimination protections to 15 groups, including gay and transgender residents. Conservative opponents of the law largely seized on the latter group, dubbing the law the ""bathroom bill"" and alleging it would have allowed men to enter women's restrooms.
At a news conference outside City Hall on Tuesday, Kubosh said council members were being ""harassed and intimated"" by the request. He called on the mayor to condemn the request and said the six council members were unfairly targeted.
""I felt like when we received this open records request for over tens of thousands of emails and 51 names of individuals and organizations that we're going to have to search through, this is a type of bullying,"" Kubosh said.
The Campaign for Accountability, a watchdog group that files records requests all over the country, responded in a written statement that the move was not meant to intimidate council members. The group called Kubosh's charge an ""outlandish allegation that seems contrived more to attract press attention than to express a serious concern.""
In an interview, deputy director Daniel Stevens also denied Kubosh's allegation that Mayor Annise Parker, a proponent of the law, was behind the request. Kubosh called it a ""lump of coal"" from the mayor.
Mayoral spokeswoman Janice Evans responded to Kubosh's comments in a written statement.
""There are hundreds of people who have made political contributions to the mayor during her 18 years in office. Receiving open records requests is very common. We tend to get one or more a day here in the mayor's office and they often come from people who disagree with something the mayor has done or a position she has taken on an issue. They can be overwhelming and time consuming to process but it is part of being an elected officeholder. If this is the first time the council member has received one, he should count himself lucky.""
In the request, filed under the Texas Public Information Act, the group said it is seeking to ""educate the public about the exact nature and extent of the coordination between Houston officials and outside organizations like the ADF and the AFA."" The ADF and the AFA, the American Family Association, are both national groups that actively opposed HERO.
Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, also attended the event in support of Kubosh and Martin. Bettencourt is planning to convene the Senate Intergovernmental Relations committee to look into why the city has been rebuffed by the Texas Supreme Court on ballot language issues, including HERO. He added Tuesday that he would seek to discuss a law that would ""limit out-of-state access to this type of punitive open records request.""",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,564,95.26,77.73,6.05,16.21,22.56,29.43,81.56,57.27,46.63,6.21,3.01,0.18,0.53,0,1.24,0.35,3.19,15.96,11.17,1.95,14.72,6.03,2.13,5.85,0.18,13.48,3.9,3.55,9.57,2.3,0.18,6.91,5.85,0.18,5.67,1.06,1.06,1.06,1.24,0,1.77,0,3.19,1.42,1.77,0.35,0,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,18.26,8.33,0.53,1.77,0.89,0.71,3.19,8.33,0,0,0.71,1.06,4.08,3.72,0.18,0.18,4.43,0,0.18,4.26,0.18,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0.35,0,0.89,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.18,3.72,7.45,1.06,0.71,5.67,0.18,0,0.18,2.48,6.38,2.84,0.89,0,0,0,0,0,14.72,4.79,4.61,0,0,1.24,4.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.04,3.44,3.14,3.59,2.5,-3.35,-1.99,-0.99,-1.1,-2.46,0.18,0.71,0,0.18,1.6,0,2.13,0,0.35,0,0,0,1.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.73,0.76,14.36,230.5,1.77,141.84,0.71,106.38,0.71,141.84,0.71,88.65,-0.53,141.84,0,460.99,0,265.96,-0.18,17.73,0.18,0,0,35.46,70.92,88.65,53.19,0,70.92,0,141.84,35.46,0,35.46,17.73,0.18,0,70.92,124.11,159.57,35.46,0,17.73,0.35,1,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.18,0,1

12/5/15,20,Campaign for Houston - Behind the Scenes with Herlinda Garcia,C4H,"my name is Rolanda Garcia and I've been
a school principal in Houston for 35
years I want to make sure that the
children are learning as much as they
can so they can be successful the most
upsetting thing is that the ordinance
allows men to use women's lockers and
bathrooms and it's a school principal I
have devoted almost half a century to
protecting children and protecting girls
so I am constantly and consistently
responsible for their safety and
security so if my faculty takes children
on a field trip the children need to use
the restroom the girls are going to use
their restroom will some men be inside
waiting for those girls to use that
restroom I find it that it's not only
inappropriate it is something that is
not permissible that we should not allow
that the public should fight against
because it is wrong it is morally wrong
I'm incredibly upset about the bathroom
ordinance that would allow men to freely
walk into women's bathrooms showers and
locker rooms this is just crazy I would
never allow a man to go into the
bathroom with my young girl students is
not just a violation of privacy it's
sickening and puts children at risk this
is already happening in Houston I was
informed by someone who works in a
middle school that a youngster there
wanted to change his clothing in a
girl's restroom and so that teacher told
the child you're going to the
principal's office because this is not
allowed well then the principal said yes
you may change your clothing or you're
going into a private restaurant so the
bottom line is ladies and gentlemen it's
already happening in Houston I urge
everyone to vote no on the bathroom
ordinance let's do this for our children",,1,304,24.51,75.49,25.39,8.11,304,22.37,89.8,71.38,58.88,17.11,8.22,3.95,0.99,1.32,0.33,1.32,8.88,16.78,7.89,0.33,11.18,12.17,5.92,7.24,2.3,20.72,4.61,1.97,3.95,1.32,0.66,1.97,15.46,1.32,14.14,0.99,5.26,2.96,1.97,0.33,2.63,0,3.62,0.99,2.3,0.99,0,0.66,0,0,0.66,0,18.09,5.92,0,0.66,0.33,1.32,0.99,12.83,0.66,0,2.63,1.97,0.33,0.33,0,0,3.95,0.33,0.66,2.96,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,0,0.33,0.66,0.33,0,0,0,0.33,1.64,0,3.29,6.91,0.66,1.32,4.93,0,0,0,3.95,2.96,8.88,2.96,0.33,0,0.33,0,0,4.28,0,0,0,0,4.28,0,0,0.66,0,2.3,0,0,3.14,2.78,2.56,2.86,-2.66,-0.98,-0.51,-1.41,-2.12,0.66,0.33,0,0,0,0,1.64,0,0,0,0,2.63,0.66,0,1.32,0,0,0.33,0,0,0.33,0,0,0,2.69,1.42,13.32,0,0,427.63,-2.3,164.47,1.64,164.47,1.64,98.68,-0.33,263.16,0.99,263.16,0,0,0,65.79,0.66,0,0,0,0,164.47,65.79,131.58,32.89,0,164.47,32.89,0,65.79,0,0,0,131.58,0,65.79,65.79,32.89,0,0.66,1,1.32,0.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.33,,3
12/4/15,20,Dr. Young HERO Ordinance,C4H,"I have in my hand a city ordinance that
those who live in Houston will vote on
on November the third it's between seven
and eight thousand words in this
ordinance I've had attorneys read it and
say you could interpret it in many many
different ways the thicker the ordinance
the thick of the bill the more latitude
you would have in its enforcement
basically it states what is already
federal law but in addition to that it
opens up our city and in short order all
the metropolitan area of houston to
something that i think is absolutely
godless you say well you're getting
political know i speak out on a very
serious moral issue
I think it was this last Tuesday my wife
Jo Beth was downtown and went into a
ladies restroom and walking out was a
man it has been purported that we
discriminate the bottom line is if we
open up our facilities when someone can
choose their sexual orientation those of
us who believe that men should use men's
facilities and women should use women's
facility we will be discriminated
against
so November the third we'll all have a
chance to vote even though you may not
live and use the buddy you live in
Houston that first ordinance when you
read it you'd say boy I'm for that but
it is totally deceptive and it is deadly
and I trust that you will vote no no no
to the first ordinance you'll read
because it will carry our city further
and further further down the road of
being totally in my opinion secular and
godless so I hope that you will get
people to vote I pray that you will vote
and this is a tremendous challenge that
we face or will have discrimination in
such a level we'll look back on these
days and we say I couldn't ever imagine

12/3/15,20,B,"King, Turner butt heads on fiscal policy in debate - Mayoral runoff rivals launch personal attacks as they argue over topics ranging from pensions to road repairs ","
Houston mayoral candidates Bill King and Sylvester Turner took aim Wednesday at each other's plans for financing road repairs and solving the city's pension problem during a tense first televised runoff debate that featured a string of personal attacks.
The showdown, hosted by KTRK-13, Univision and Mi Familia Vota from the University of Houston-Downtown, hit topics ranging from gun violence, sanctuary cities and Syrian refugees to public safety, education and inequality.
Yet King and Turner butted heads most vigorously on questions of fiscal policy that have defined the campaign as Houston confronts a projected $126 million deficit next fiscal year, largely the product of a voter-approved cap on property tax collections, soaring pension obligations and a looming spike in city debt payments.
""You go from complex to impenetrable when you start to talk about the specifics of these issues and how each campaign is misrepresenting the issues of the other campaign,"" said University of Houston political scientist Brandon Rottinghaus, who attended the debate. ""You've got confusing positions and you've got confused voters, both of which are a recipe, in a low-turnout election, for people simply to not turn out to vote.""
Turner, a 26-year state representative running his third campaign for Houston mayor, finished atop a 13-candidate mayoral field on Nov. 3, earning 31 percent of the vote to King's 25 percent. Early voting for the Dec. 12 runoff runs through Dec. 8.
Turner won most of Houston's left-leaning, majority-minority City Council districts, while King took three conservative council districts, most of them majority-white, and earned a plurality in progressive District C.
The once-cordial opponents looking to replace term-limited Mayor Annise Parker were not shy Wednesday about launching personal attacks, echoing some of the criticisms being levied in their television commercials and delivered to voters' mailboxes.
King, the former mayor of Kemah, took Turner to task for repeatedly criticizing him for naming a boat he previously owned ""Hard Times.""
""The boat was named after a boat that was owned by the founder of Kemah, where I grew up,"" King said, later accusing Turner of lying about the origins of the name. ""Why did y'all lie about it and say I named it Hard Times to mock poor people?""
King then used an anecdote about falling out of his boat into Galveston Bay as a thinly-veiled reference to an incendiary KTRK story aired during the 1991 mayor's race, in Turner's first bid for the office. The broadcast linked Turner to an alleged insurance scam, devastating his campaign.
""I was out one day I was trying to get a line loose and I fell off the boat into Galveston Bay, but instead of vanishing and turning in a false insurance claim I just swam back over and got back on my boat,"" King said, as the crowd stirred.
Turner sued KTRK and the reporter for libel. Turner won the case and a $5.5 million award in trial, but both were overturned on appeal.
'Kind of nasty' Turner attacked King's business record, criticizing him for the 1980s bankruptcy of a savings and loan he ran, among other ventures.
""You cannot say that you're the businessperson if you have been in three businesses - a savings and loan in particular - and they've gone under and you've left people holding the bag,"" Turner said, before addressing his own record in business and elected office. ""No, I'm not a career politician. I'm a public servant. Everything in my public record is fair game, but I have been a successful public servant for 26 years.""
Rottinghaus cast the exchange, which led to some fidgeting among the crowd, as ""kind of nasty.""
""These interactions, I think, can be telling,"" he said. ""Mayors have to negotiate with people. How they can punch and counterpunch should be meaningful to people.""
Asked whether he could be expected to address the city's rising pension costs when Houston's three employee groups have all endorsed him, Turner named a slate of other prominent supporters, and said they know solving problems is about building consensus.
""They recognize I've been in the Legislature 26 years working with Democrats and Republicans alike building a consensus,"" Turner said.
Turner criticized King's proposal to issue bonds to cover the city's pension underfunding of $3.2 billion as part of a reform package reducing retirement benefits for new hires.
""The math simply doesn't add up,"" Turner said, contending issuing that much debt risks tax increases, credit downgrades, or even bankruptcy.
ReBuild Houston
King dismissed these assertions, saying the city is paying those debts today with each pension payment, at an interest rate of 8 to 8.5 percent, the pension funds' assumed rates of return on their investments. Interest on the bonds he wants to issue could be half that, King said.
""If you had a house loan at 8 percent, wouldn't you want to refinance it at 4 percent? That's not increasing the debt, that's reducing your debt service,"" King said. ""The problem is Sylvester's friends. We're borrowing it from them at 8 percent and they want us to keep doing that. I don't think that's fair to the taxpayers.""
The mayoral hopefuls later confronted each other over ReBuild Houston, the city's controversial pay-as-you-go street and drainage improvement program.
""We passed this ReBuild Houston program five years ago, we agree to impose an additional $100 million a year in taxes on ourselves to fix the streets and drainage,"" King said. ""So far I haven't met anybody who thinks the streets and drainage are better off than they were five years ago.""
King said the drainage fee he opposes could be scrapped and still leave plenty of funds for roads repairs if the city could issue debt using the other dollars still left in the dedicated ReBuild fund.
Turner reiterated his support for a pay-as-you-go approach to infrastructure investment.
""We are a growing, developing city, which means we have been lagging behind in our infrastructure. We can't do it the way we used to do it. Bill proposes issuing bonds, but you've got to pay the debt service,"" Turner said. ""We shouldn't do it that way. We need to do the pay-as-you-go and move forward.""
More than 29,000 Houston voters cast a ballot during the first day of early voting Wednesday, about 11,000 of them in person and another 18,000 by mail.

12/3/15,20,Campaign for Houston - Behind the Scenes with Lance Berkman,C4H,"vote no on proposition one no men in
women's bathrooms no boys and girls
showers or locker rooms I'm Lance
Berkman I played professional baseball
for 15 years but my family is more
important I mean I have four daughters
and the thought of them being in a
public bathroom and having a man walk in
there which I mean I who knows I mean
who knows what the intent of that person
might be I mean they truly might think
they're a woman which is a little
strange to me but they could be a child
predator they could be somebody that's
in there who likes to look at women and
just claims to be a woman so I just feel
like that this opens a can of worms that
I'm not comfortable putting my family in
the position to have this thing passed
my wife and I have four daughters
proposition 1 the bathroom ordinance
would allow troubled men to enter
women's public bathrooms showers and
locker rooms this would violate their
privacy and put them in harm's way well
as a husband and a father you feel like
you're in a position of a protector over
your family and I want to like to
protect my girls from as many threats
that are out there as I possibly can and
this is something that is pretty overt I
mean you get into a situation where you
have four girls and maybe two or three
of them are going to a public bathroom
and obviously I'm not going to go in
there with them I mean is there a guy in
there that could potentially be a child
predator I don't know and I don't want
to have to worry about that if we're
going to go down to the zoo or I just
want to be able to live life without
having to have an extra thing to worry
about and as it when it comes to
protecting my family and so that's one
reason that yes I am concerned about
this as a dad and as a husband I don't
want to put the the women that I'm
responsible for in any sort of an
awkward position and I feel like that
this has the extreme potential to be
able to do that this proposed ordinance
says that it will stop discrimination
but in reality it discriminates against
people who believe like me that members
of the opposite sex should not be forced
to share restrooms or locker rooms I
mean it's crazy and it just kind of
makes me want to say from a guy that I
used to like to listen to Earl pits used
to say wake up America and that's what I
want to scream at people because I mean
what are we doing here I mean we have
the potential for men
going into a woman's bathroom I mean
that the the very few people that this
could even be slanted as being
discriminating against is it worth
putting the majority of our population
at risk or potentially putting them at
risk to to appease a very small minority
of the population I don't think so i
think it's crazy and it is unbelievable
that we are even talking about this join
me to stop the violation of women's
privacy and discrimination against women
vote no on proposition one no men in
women's bathrooms no boys and girls
showers or locker room my message to
other fathers is to get out there and
vote I mean we have to use the
democratic process to try to rise up
against this threat and the only way
that we can do that is to go and vote no
against proposition one

12/2/15,20,B,For mayor - Vote for Sylvester Turner as a balance between policy and politics. ,"
We thought that there wasn't such a thing as a Democratic or Republican pothole, but Sylvester Turner has proved us wrong. In a race that's supposed to be about the issues - pensions, public safety and, yes, potholes - Turner has gone full negative. His campaign is spending enormous amounts of money to hammer his opponent Bill King on matters that range from small to minute. Policies have been misrepresented. History has been distorted. A boat's name has become a topic of speculation.
Politics doesn't have to be a dirty game, and Houston's nonpartisan elections have the fortune of avoiding the inherent battle lines that seem to dominate the national political conversation. Houstonians can feel free to vote for the candidate they think will do the best job, rather than worry about backing their home team.
Ideally, this means that ma- yoral candidates have the luxury of rising above the political fray and focusing on our city's future. That's the sort of campaign that Turner ran during the general election. That's the Turner we hope to see as mayor.
The long-time state representative - and three-time mayoral candidate - offers voters the best balance between policy expertise and political acumen. As Houstonians have witnessed on issues like red light cameras, pensions and the Houston equal rights ordinance, having the right ideas isn't enough. The mayor also has to usher policies through a political system of competing perspectives and countervailing powers.
Houston's City Charter grants our mayor a degree of authority unique among Texas cities, with nearly total control over the executive and legislative functions at City Hall. But the mayor isn't a dictator and still needs to build consensus - one of Turner's political skills.
There's much to admire in King's passion for public policy. He has a firm grasp on the challenges facing City Hall, and there's often little difference between him and Turner when it comes to listing the problems that vex our city.
But Houstonians deserve a City Hall that can address more than the mere basics. Yes, we can fix the roads, balance the budget and catch the crooks. We can also build roads that serve pedestrians and cyclists alongside drivers. We can balance the budget without burdening public servants. And we can catch the crooks while offering the after school programs that keep kids from falling into a life of crime.
We've also yet to see a solid proposal that sets Houston on a fiscally sustainable path without raising the revenue cap, which restricts property tax collection combined rates of inflation and population growth. Moody's Investors Service specifically pointed to the trifecta of rising pension obligations, spiking debt payments and the city's revenue cap as threats to Houston's financial well- being. Turner wants to address all three of those issues. King instead continues to falsely equate lifting the revenue cap with a tax hike.
In the final year of the Parker administration, Houston feels like anything but a well-oiled machine. It is easy to point out the flaws in our city - and in the two candidates seeking to lead it. Both Turner and King would be able repairmen, but Turner boasts the talents best suited to the political problems that City Hall faces today.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,534,85.47,69.5,8.31,15.99,17.8,25.66,79.96,57.3,45.88,7.49,3.37,0,2.25,0,0.75,0.37,4.12,15.92,9.93,0.56,13.3,7.3,3.56,6.74,0.75,11.24,6.55,4.12,9.18,2.43,1.69,5.62,11.24,0.56,10.49,1.87,0.37,2.81,1.69,0.19,3.37,0,3.37,1.5,1.87,0.75,0.37,0.37,0.19,0.19,0,0,10.49,3.18,0.37,0,0.37,0.75,0.75,6.93,0.19,0,0.19,1.5,6.37,6.18,0,0.19,4.87,0.37,0.19,2.06,3,0,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0.37,0.56,0.75,0.19,0,0.19,0.56,0,4.68,8.43,0.75,1.69,5.06,0.75,0,0.56,2.06,1.69,5.43,1.87,0.37,0,0.37,0,0,14.42,5.62,3.18,0,0,3.56,2.06,0,0.37,0.19,0.19,0,0.37,3.42,3.57,3.02,3.21,2.53,-2.89,-0.91,-0.59,-0.11,-1.9,0.94,0,0.19,0.19,0.37,0.37,0,0,0.94,0,0,0.19,0.37,0,0.19,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,2.72,1.51,21.98,112.36,0.75,299.63,-0.19,262.17,2.43,224.72,2.25,187.27,-1.5,337.08,1.31,468.16,0,374.53,0.37,0,0,0,0,0,187.27,187.27,18.73,56.18,37.45,-0.19,149.81,131.09,56.18,18.73,37.45,0.37,0,74.91,18.73,74.91,0,0,18.73,1.5,1,0,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.19,1

12/1/15,20,B,"At-large - In runoff elections, the best candidates are Provost, Robinson, Edwards and Christie. ","At-Large 1: Georgia Provost
The runoff to succeed term-limited Councilman Steve Costello is a study in contrasts. Mike Knox, who led a crowded field in the general election with about 25 percent of the vote, is a former Houston police officer and the author of a book on gang and youth violence. His focus is on bringing the city budget under control by instituting what he calls ""a confirmed revenue stream budget.""
His opponent, Georgia Provost, is a photographer and owner of a photography studio and public relations firm. A longtime community activist in the Third and Fifth wards, she is a fundraiser for various charitable organizations supporting youth and law enforcement, a leader with the Texas Metropolitan Organization and executive director of the Texas Southern University Bayou Bend Alumni/Ex-Students Association Inc. This is the second council race for both candidates.
Knox is articulate and knowledgeable about the issues, but Provost brings grass-roots awareness and years of experience helping solve problems in her community. We believe those are qualifications that will prove valuable on the council. We're confident she will speak up for Houstonians too often ignored by city government. We endorse Provost.
At-Large 2: David Robinson
At-large council members are supposed to represent citywide interests, and David Robinson takes that charge seriously. Last year, the first-term councilman attended every single community meeting for Houston's annual Capital Improvement Plan.
On council, he's thrown himself into the quality-of-life issues that help transform Houston from a city where people want to work into a place where people want to live. Robinson is also one of the few council members who has focused on coastal storm surge protection - a key issue that deserves more attention from City Hall. Unlike so many politicians, Robinson gets the big picture.
In this runoff, Robinson is challenged by Willie Davis, a pastor who ran largely on the anti-HERO ticket. The Houston equal rights ordinance fight is over for now, but City Council will still have to face problems of infrastructure, pensions and ensuring Houston's long-term success. Robinson is clearly best-suited to address these important issues.
At-Large 4: Amanda Edwards
Candidates often like to run as symbols of a greater issue: the conservative candidate, the community representative, the education wonk. In this race to replace term-limited Councilman C.O. Bradford, Amanda Edwards has become a sign of Houston's future - hard-working, engaged and passionate.
A municipal finance lawyer with Bracewell and Giuliani, Edwards has more on-the-ground experience than plenty of politicians twice her age (she's 33). A graduate of Harvard Law School, she has spent years working for community development corporations and nonprofits across the country, from Atlanta (where she served as student body president at Emory University) to New Orleans (where she moved after Hurricane Katrina).
She has built a strong coalition of African-American voters, business leaders and forward-thinking urbanists who all want to make Houston a better city and who see Edwards as the sort of person who can get it done. That across-the-board support gave her 35 percent of the vote in a crowded general election.
She could have gone anywhere to make a fortune, but instead Edwards moved back to her hometown and stepped up to help her community. Particularly impressive is her service as president of the board of directors for Project Row Houses - a world-famous creative endeavor that transformed old shotgun houses into art studios in the Third Ward.
Edwards is running against Roy Morales, a former Harris County school trustee who ran for mayor in 2010. At this point, Morales looks all too much like one of those perennial candidates who runs more out of self-promotion than public service. Edwards is our choice.
At-Large 5: Jack Christie
For the past four years, Jack Christie has proven to be one of the most confounding members on City Council. He's collaborative, soft-spoken and effective at working behind the scenes. He's also expressed a personal opposition to vaccinations and water fluoridation.
Still, to this day, you can count on one hand the number of times that Christie has raised these issues at City Council. There are also plenty of times when the incumbent proved himself to be a well-prepared workhorse.
Christie faces a challenge from Sharon Moses, a former City Council staffer. When she met with the Houston Chronicle editorial board, Moses said she wasn't running to oust the incumbent. If there's no reason to boot him from office, voters should re-elect Christie.",Houston Eqaul Rights Ordinance ,1,739,89.33,80.19,6.44,58.36,19.45,31.94,80.65,55.89,44.52,7.58,5.14,0,0.54,0.14,3.38,0,2.44,14.61,8.12,2.57,14.21,5.95,3.79,4.87,0.27,11.77,5.28,5.28,9.2,2.84,2.44,3.92,7.71,0.54,7.17,1.49,0.68,1.35,0.95,0.68,2.17,0,4.33,3.25,0.81,0.41,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,13.53,2.71,1.08,0,0.27,0.14,0.41,9.07,0,0,2.17,1.22,4.33,4.19,0.14,0,8.12,0.14,0.41,6.5,1.22,0.14,0.81,0.14,0.14,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.41,0.41,0,0.27,0,0.41,0.27,0.27,3.38,8.66,0.95,1.89,5.41,0.41,0,0,3.52,2.98,5.01,1.22,0,0,0,0,0,17.05,5.28,4.47,0,0,1.35,5.95,0,0.68,0,0,0,0,2.94,2.89,2.83,3.05,2.45,-1.86,-1.03,0.04,-0.27,-0.44,0.68,0.41,0.54,0.27,0.68,0,1.35,0,0.95,0,0.27,0,0.41,0.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.56,0.77,17.97,270.64,2.3,243.57,0.54,257.1,2.3,230.04,2.17,54.13,-0.27,419.49,0.54,595.4,0,121.79,-0.14,0,0,13.53,0,27.06,202.98,135.32,40.6,0,81.19,0,108.25,54.13,27.06,13.53,13.53,0.14,0,40.6,13.53,94.72,27.06,13.53,13.53,0.95,1,0,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
